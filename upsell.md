Hey and welcome you're in thank you so much for deciding to invest and join us inside the 7 day
AI ad catalyst you're in for an awakening to put it simply you're going to basically jump at a
time machine and go about five years in the future from probably how you were working before and also
with what you thought was possible so don't worry you're in exactly the right place so just stay on
this page with me don't click away don't hit the back button that might mess up your order
this video is not long and what I'm about to share could completely transform the next year few years
three months of your life of your business and how quickly you are able to not just implement and
be able to produce more and more winning advertising ad creatives but to actually level up many aspects
of your business because it's not just ads are important they're key but they're just one part of a long chain
and if that entire chain isn't strong then there are gaps there's a weak link
so by investing in the 7 day AI ad catalyst you're going to learn some incredible tools
and incredible workflows new paradigms and new frameworks one thing that I'm really excited about
is is just the 30 minute training that I show you of how to use this new AI tool where it really
becomes like a super intelligent personal assistant just right there next to you and you'll see me go through
starting from zero
I go into Facebook and I find a couple ads from a brand
and I paste them in
and you'll see me over the course of seven
just back and forths
we are able to produce a analysis of the winning elements of all of those ads
a winning ad template which includes all of the elements across the entire ad
we create hooks we create variations we create different audience segments product brief audience briefs
we take winning ads and break them across awareness levels we create about
ow
you combine them all probably over a hundred different variations we do it in under
honestly probably under 20 minutes
with seven back and forths and there was no mistakes
and that's just the tool that's just
using that tool
what you're really going to learn is
how to begin to think
about
how do we integrate AI effectively
what does it even mean
to have this as
part of our business
as part of my
daily productivity
what does it mean to
have
you know
intelligence on demand
how do I use that
it's completely new
it's like
going to people that are used to
using horses
and
talking about
engines and
wheels
and
cars
they just
they don't have a concept for it
and what you're going to be learning here
is
you'll build a conceptual framework
and mental model
you'll begin to
see
oh
I get it
okay
that's how we look at things
and that makes it really
straightforward to see how we can plug in
this tool
or that tool
or this kind of AI
and
that's going to accelerate you so far
beyond your competition
beyond the rest of the world
because so much of the world
has
no idea
what's been happening with AI
most of the
news articles
in the last few months
have actually talked about
how AI
has stalled
in 2024
now we're in 2025
now
and I find that hilarious
because
I've been using models
that
for the
first time
really feel like
a
super intelligent human
that I have access to
at any time
and
right when I was impressed
by that one
open AI
the big lab
announced one
that was about
five times smarter
two days later
after I started
really using that
and then
the next few days
there's all these news articles
about AI
hasn't
progressed
or done anything
it's been behind the scenes
and that should actually
kind of scare you
because
it's like this tsunami
that's building
and nobody's aware of it
and it's about to smack down
on everybody
and
it does frighten me
a little bit
because
this has never happened before
this
is an entirely new paradigm
of technology
and then
just in the last few days
a Chinese lab
released something called
DeepSeek
which basically takes that
most intelligent model
from open AI
and makes it open source
you can run it probably
on your phone
in a few weeks
the world is changing
very very very rapidly
so
just jumping in here
and learning how to use
these tools
inside a very
very specific outcome
how do we
take some ads
use these tools
to be able to produce
more winning ads
do we not have to hire
copywriters
or
have this whole project
and back and forth
and team
to just
turn out some variations
that have a good chance
of helping us
make more sales
profitably
so
you made an incredibly wise
decision
you might not even
realize it yet
you
didn't just buy
you know
some
quick fix course
you
are
jumping into the future
and
that's a big deal
take some courage
it shows that you are
on the cutting edge
that you are
forward thinking
you're
open minded
you're also aware
you see what's happening
and
you wanted to take
the step
to figure out
how do I use this
in my business
in my life
to
win
to
stay competitive
just
maintain
and
persist
and
grow the ability
for me to
provide
for my team
for my family
so
you've made
a powerful
powerful decision
you will be
I almost don't envy you
because
after you begin
to go through this
there's not many people
to talk to
about
because
most people
don't understand
and
well
AI is coming
for many
many
many jobs
it look like
what I'm going to
teach you how to do
in about 20 minutes
basically
takes the team
of
copywriter
multiple copywriters
media buyer
maybe project manager
probably a team
what might be
a week or two
back and forth
it's now just you
at a computer
talking
you literally
just record your voice
and transcribe it
and boom
back and forth
it's done
it's ready to go
but that's just
using it to make ads
the tool that I'm going to show you
is actually can be used
across anything
so
you want to analyze
some spreadsheets
cool
that's the job
for whoever
used to analyze spreadsheets
that you no longer
need to hire
which is great
and it's also
again frightening
in
what's going to happen
what's going to shift
so
that's
that's kind of
the bad news
is
we are entering
there's something called
the singularity
that they've been talking about
it's
the
the point on an exponential curve
where
to us at the bottom of the curve
it just looks vertical
now it never is quite
fully vertical
but
think about it
think about the entire amount of technological growth
that humanity went through
up until
I don't know
the horse drawn carriage
you know
like
pretty significant
you know
wheels and fire
didn't have electricity yet
but
we learned how to
build all these things
and then
think about from that time
to
when electricity was invented
and then from
you know
electricity to
the railroads
and then railroads to
airplanes
and then airplanes to computers
and then the internet
really wasn't
a thing much
until
2005
the iPhone
wasn't even released
until
what
2009
and here we are
look
at what has happened
just the last year of AI
we have made
more progress
than people thought we might make in 100 years
and
it used to be
every few years
you might have a breakthrough
it is now
every few days
inside
the world of AI
that we have some
mind-boggling breakthrough
that nobody thought was possible
and that's a particularly
significant
growth
to happen
because AI
isn't just like
okay cool
we learned how to like
do things faster
it's no
you can use AI
to
make better AI
it's an exponentially
self-improving
kind of
deal
so
things are accelerating
rapidly
and
and
the thing about
the singularity
is
when
you have
you know
a hundred years worth
say from
1901
to
2001
when you have
a hundred years worth
of technological change
happening in
50 years
then
10 years
then
a year
then six months
then three months
then a month
then two weeks
then a week
it's going to get to the point
where that's happening
every day
and then even multiple times a day
and I know it's hard
to wrap your brain around
it's hard for me
and I've been into this stuff
my entire life
but what that means is
everything that we have
been taught
or
really our conceptions of
how to plan
how to strategize
in the world
no longer really apply
because we are in a
completely different world
so
you as
a business owner
as an advertiser
as somebody who
is out there
engaged with
the world
selling a product
selling a service
you have a team
you may have a family
you have people that depend on you
you just have your own survival
and
security at stake as well
how do we plan for this
how do you plan
when you can't predict
what the world is going to be like
that's a very good question
I don't have a
nice pretty answer
that I can wrap up
and put in a bow
and a hand to you
but it's been something
I've been thinking about
for
over 10 years
and
it's a vast topic
it's not something
I can cover in a
you know
short 10 minute video
but
I think that is
probably one of the most
important things
is
how do we prepare
for the unpreparable
how do we
position ourselves
to make sure
that we don't get
side swiped
by changes
how do we
make a moat
how do we
create resilience
within our business
and
how do we keep up to date
with
all of the changes
is coming out
every single day
now
like every week
there's a new thing
that if you integrated
it in the right place
could dramatically
transform your business
now
where do you integrate that
how do you integrate that
who can do it for you
how much should it cost
do you even need to
is that the place
to be spending
your energy on
these are all questions
that
you would have to answer
and
unless you're an expert
and love
staying up to date
and hanging out with
all of the weirdos
on
you know
the far bleeding edge
of AI
in that corner
of
what's formerly known
as Twitter
you probably won't
ask those questions
just keep doing
what you're doing
because you got
enough to do
and
that's where
if you're resonating
with this
and you're still
still watching
then
you're who I'm speaking to
there's people that
they've already
bounced
they just
they don't want to hear
it
the world is
going to stay the same
but
if you're still here
if you're kind of
resonating
then you're
the kind of person
that
I'm looking for
because it's really
important
that
we have
more and more
people who at least
have an awareness
a framework
a way of understanding
when the world
changes so rapidly
how to adapt
because
not only can that
allow us to take care
of ourselves
and the people
that
we care about
but it also
it allows us to
really
help
the other people
around us
who
win technology
maybe when they
lose their jobs
and they are wondering
like what do I do
you know
we could be a source
of leadership
we could be a source
of hope
we can help them
at least
find some footing
in order to continue
you know
walking upright
and not just
give up
amongst
the crazy amount
of change
if this is resonating
with you
then
I am putting together
a group
of remarkable
individuals
individuals
and
I would like to
invite you
to join us
and so
this is a
new community
and it will be
we'll be delving it
as
you know
we onboard
the founding members
and get things rolling
but
the general plan
is basically
what you just went through
you can consider
like a workshop
or
the product
that you bought
you're going to be
going through
it's a specific outcome
how do we use
these tools
to create more ads
well there's a lot
of outcomes
that all matter
inside of business
that you can utilize
AI to use
I am going to be
going through
all of the most
important ones
of those
over the following
weeks
months
probably years
and
each one
will likely
become a product
and
you could
buy that
individually
or
if you join
the community
then
that will just be
part of
your
membership
and
maybe some of them
I'll do them live
where you can
jump on
and ask questions
after I do things
I will
plan to have
office hours
each week
basically
have a
handful of
slots of hours
where people
can just jump on
and
ask me
whatever
strategize
you know
this new thing
came out
how can I use
this
plus
when new
technology comes
out
I'll be sharing
hey here's this
thing
here's what to
think about it
here's how it might
be useful
here's if you're
in this business
or this business
then this is where
it could be
really helpful
and
there's also just be
a community of
other people
they'll be asking
questions that you
might not think to
ask
I'll be helping
give you answers
and it's a way
to keep your
finger on the
pulse
and stay
nimble
and have the
kind of
resources
guidance
expertise
on tap
to navigate
all of the
crazy shifts
and changes
that are
happening
so
that's my
hard pitch
if you're still
here
and you
weirdly get
what I'm
talking about
then
you're the
kind of person
that I want
in there
and
so
you can see
the options
down below
it's
to some of you
might be
really cheap
might be
really expensive
but
we want to
create a
very high
level
high quality
group
of individuals
so down below
you can pick
one or more
packages
of how
you'd like
to invest
your tuition
into that
community
and as well
as some
details on
what else
is included
and planned
and any
updates we
may have
added
since I
recorded this
and
yeah
thanks for
diving in
I hope you
really enjoy
the product
if you have
any questions
or anything
reach out to
us
we want to
continue to
improve
all the
experience
for
all of
our
customers
and clients
and
I would
love to
see you
inside the
community
I would
love to
hear your
questions
see what
you're
seeing
and
be a
meeting
of the
minds
and figure
out how
all of
us can
be best
positioned
to take
advantage
of all
this
new
change
and tech
coming
out
and also
be in a
place
where
we
can
continue
to
serve
and
protect
and
provide
for
those
that
we
care
about
those
that
we
have
responsibility
