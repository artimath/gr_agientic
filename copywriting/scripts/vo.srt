1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,800
This is a seven-minute video that could change your advertising forever.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,020
In the next seven days, you could be running 50 high-performing ad variations

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,780
in the time it takes your competitors to create one.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,880
There's a breakthrough AI method that smart advertisers are using to cut their ad costs

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,740
by 40% while getting better results.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,180
It's the same system I developed while creating campaigns for brands

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,280
spending $100,000 plus daily on ads, and now you can too.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,440
My name is Ryan Hunter, and while you might not know me yet, you've seen the ads I've helped create.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,860
I've written campaigns for some of the biggest direct response companies in the world.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,240
I led the copywriting team at a brand spending $100,000 daily on ads,

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,380
creating scripts for campaigns that scaled from $100 per day to $100,000 per day.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
But what makes me different is my background.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,680
I started as a programmer before becoming a marketer.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,080
This unique perspective helped me spot something everyone else missed.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,320
this system could transform your ad performance in 20 minutes a day,

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,940
no complex AI knowledge needed, no expensive tools,

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,440
no hiring teams of copywriters.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,040
In fact, it works with any budget from $10,000 to $100,000 per day.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,140
It's all possible because of a breakthrough in AI technology

20
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,720
that lets anyone anywhere, regardless of technical skill or marketing experience,

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,100
follow seven daily steps and multiply their best ads automatically.

22
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,060
It's like having a team of 50 copywriters working around the clock,

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:42,255
but you stay in control This is the same system being used by the top direct response companies who need to scale fast while keeping costs down The ones spending millions on ads

24
00:01:43,414 --> 00:01:45,034
Names you'd recognize instantly.

25
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:50,975
I discovered this while creating their campaigns and saw how the real pros were using AI behind

26
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:51,454
the scenes.

27
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:52,814
That's when I realized.

28
00:01:54,095 --> 00:02:00,615
The experts say one thing about AI publicly, but do something completely different in

29
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:07,735
private. They're using AI to test hundreds of variations while everyone else tests one at a time

30
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:14,035
manually. But this advantage won't last forever. As more advertisers catch on, this edge will disappear.

31
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:20,415
I estimate you have six to 12 months max before this becomes the new normal, and the advantage

32
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:26,055
is gone. I've used these AI principles to create successful campaigns for major brands,

33
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:29,755
and now I've turned it into a system anyone can use.

34
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,475
Whether you're a local shop or global brand,

35
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,775
this approach can transform how you run ads.

36
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,114
After seeing how well this worked in my own campaigns,

37
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:39,795
I knew I had to make it accessible to other businesses.

38
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,595
The big agencies are charging thousands for similar services,

39
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,674
but I've packaged everything I've learned

40
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,394
into a system anyone can follow.

41
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:51,355
This isn't about better copywriting or mastering Facebook's interface.

42
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:55,635
It's not about spending more money or hiring expensive agencies,

43
00:02:56,055 --> 00:03:01,775
And it has nothing to do with what most AI experts tell you about using chat GPT for ads.

44
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,755
That's why only a small group of insiders know about this approach.

45
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:06,695
Here's why you've never heard about this.

46
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:20,450
All you need is a computer in 20 minutes per day to multiply your best performing ads into dozens of optimized variations The AI learns what works in your market and creates new versions that maintain your voice and message

47
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:28,569
The big ad agencies don't want you knowing this because they charge thousands for what you can do yourself in minutes.

48
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,470
Two years ago, something big happened in AI technology.

49
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,730
The media missed it, but it created an opportunity for advertisers.

50
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,030
who understood his potential.

51
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,790
While everyone focused on chat GPT for writing basic ads,

52
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,170
the real breakthrough was in pattern recognition and multiplication.

53
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,329
The biggest advertisers quietly started using this to scale their campaigns faster than ever before.

54
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,829
They could test more variations in a day than most businesses test in a month.

55
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,889
This is why you see some advertisers crushing it while others struggle with rising costs.

56
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,790
Once you start using the system,

57
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,650
you'll know exactly how to turn one winning ad into 50-plus profitable variations in 20 minutes per day.

58
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,209
And there's nothing your competitors can do to stop you,

59
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,470
because you'll always be 20 steps ahead.

60
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,050
I package everything into a step-by-step system

61
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,910
called the seven-day AI ad catalyst.

62
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,970
It shows you exactly how to implement this in your business,

63
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:22,289
even if you're not technical.

64
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:24,770
Here's what's possible with this system.

65
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,710
Cut costs per sale by up to 40%.

66
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,190
Test more ad variations in a day than most test in a month.

67
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,150
Scale winning ads faster while maintaining performance.

68
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,770
Find hidden profitable audiences automatic.

69
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:41,389
I'm sharing this because I'm tired of seeing good businesses struggle with outdated methods.

70
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:54,685
The big agencies want to keep this secret charging thousands for what you can do yourself By sharing the system I leveling the playing field Here what happens when you get access 1 You get the complete 7 system

71
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:58,685
2. Each day has 1 20-minute task.

72
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:04,685
3. By day 7, you'll have an automated AI ad system.

73
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:09,685
4. Your best ads get multiplied into dozens of variations.

74
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,685
5.

75
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,685
Testing happens automatically while you sleep.

76
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:18,185
Six, you stay in control while AI does the heavy lifting.

77
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,185
Think about what this means.

78
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,685
Instead of testing two to three ads per week,

79
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,185
you could be running 50 plus variations.

80
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:26,685
Instead of guessing what works,

81
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,685
you'll have data showing exactly what performs best.

82
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,685
And instead of watching your ad costs rise,

83
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:36,185
you could be finding new profitable audiences automatically.

84
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:37,685
Because I want this to work for you,

85
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,685
I've made this as accessible as possible.

86
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,685
The AI tools alone would cost you

87
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:51,025
$500 or more per month. Hiring an agency would be $3,000 per month plus. But you won't pay anywhere

88
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:56,745
near that. Try the entire system risk-free for a full year. Use it to multiply your ads and cut your
