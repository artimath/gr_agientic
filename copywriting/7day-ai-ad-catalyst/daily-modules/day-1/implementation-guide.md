## Common Questions

**Q: What if I don't have many winning ads?** A: Use your best performing ad and any ads that showed promise (good CTR but maybe not conversion). Include competitor ads that work well in your market.

**Q: How much data do I need?** A: Aim for at least 3 ads, but more is better. Quality over quantity - one great performing ad is worth more than 10 mediocre ones.

**Q: What metrics matter most?** A: Focus on final conversion metrics (CPA, ROAS) first, then engagement metrics (CTR, engagement rate) second.
