Subject: Day 1: Let's Build Your AI Ad Foundation (20 mins) ðŸš€

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey {First Name}!

Tired of watching your ad costs rise while results decline? Today, we're going to flip the script.

Here's the thing: hidden in your existing ads is a goldmine of patterns that work for YOUR market. We just need to teach AI how to find them and multiply them.

That's exactly what we'll do today, and it only takes 20 minutes.

**Your Big Action for Today:** Create your AI training foundation from your best-performing ads.

Here's all you need to do:

1. **Export Your Data (5 mins)**

  - Open Facebook Ads Manager
  - Last 90 days
  - Export to CSV (Quick video guide attached)

2. **Feed It to AI (10 mins)**

  - Copy the prompt below
  - Open ChatGPT
  - Paste & add your data (I've included the exact prompt to use)

3. **Quick Review (5 mins)**

  - Scan the AI output
  - Add anything missing (Checklist included)

That's it! No complex analysis needed - AI will do the heavy lifting.

**The Prompt to Use:**

```
I'll paste my Facebook ad data below. Analyze it and create an AI training corpus that includes:

1\. What patterns make my best ads work
2\. My brand voice and style
3\. Best performing hooks
4\. Winning benefit structures
5\. Effective CTAs
6\. Key metrics to beat

Format it in a way that's optimized for AI to understand and replicate my winning patterns.

Here's my ad data:
[PASTE YOUR CSV HERE]
```

Don't worry if you only have a few ads - even one winning ad gives AI enough to work with!

I'll check in this evening to make sure you're all set.

To your success, [Your Name]
