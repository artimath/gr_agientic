# Day 5: Algorithm Training

## Your 20-Minute Action Plan

### Step 1: Review Your Events (5 mins)

1. Open Events Manager
2. Check conversion tracking
3. Note gaps in data

### Step 2: Configure Advanced Tracking (10 mins)

Copy this prompt:

```
I'll paste my conversion events below. Help me create a complete tracking setup that includes:

1\. Micro-conversions (smaller actions that lead to purchase)
2\. Value optimization opportunities
3\. Custom events worth tracking
4\. Advanced matching options

Here's my current setup:
[PASTE YOUR EVENTS]

Current metrics:
- Main conversion: [X]
- Current CPA: [X]
- Value per conversion: [X]
```

### Step 3: Implement Tracking (5 mins)

1. Set up recommended events
2. Update conversion values
3. Configure custom events
4. Verify tracking

## Common Questions

**Q: Which events matter most?** A: Focus on actions that correlate with purchases/conversions.

**Q: How many events should I track?** A: Start with 3-5 key events, add more as needed.

**Q: When will I see improvements?** A: Algorithm needs 50-100 events to optimize - usually 3-7 days.
