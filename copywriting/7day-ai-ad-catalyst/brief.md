# 10\. Background Story + Story of Discovery

Ryan Hunter spent 15+ years coding and transitioned to marketing at a solar company. Managing $100k/day in ad spend, he saw costs constantly rising and results declining. Initially skeptical of AI, he discovered its potential when AI-written ads outperformed his best copywriters by 20x while taking a fraction of the time to create. This led to developing a simplified system that any business owner could implement in just 20 minutes per day. The breakthrough came when he realized AI could not just write ads, but could predict audience behavior and prevent ad fatigue before it happened - all while requiring minimal human oversight.
