All right, everybody.

So today we're going to go through a bit of the workflow that we have laid out here.

So for the seven day AI ad catalyst, we're going to go through day one where we're going to create the ad profile, the winning ad profile.

And I'm going to show you how to do that with an amazing tool, probably the best tool for using AI and AI agents inside your workflow.

And it's called cursor.

So by now you probably should have had it set up and installed.

This is basically what it looked like.

The theme might be different, but everything I reset to make sure it's going to look like a fresh install.

And so it's a code editor, but we're not going to use it for code.

It's just for text.

So what we're going to do is-- so let's start out.

Day one, we want to first export your best performers.

And then let AI analyze the patterns.

So let's see.

How do we want to start that?

Well, let's go and let's say-- we're going to right click over here.

So this is the folder.

And we'll do new file.

And we'll do winning ads.

And we can just make it a text file.

And let's go to-- let's go to Facebook ad library.

We're just going to pick out a brand.

And let's go-- let's see.

Add category, all ads.

And let's look up-- let's do an e-commerce company.

Let's do like-- wallets.

Let's try that.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

And we'll see if it can pop up here.

Okay.

Let's try this over here.

Pause for a moment.

All right.

So here we are.

Let's take a look.

Let's see filters.

Active.

Okay.

Let's do.

Okay. mm.

Okay.

Let's do this.

Right now.

Yeah, so let's do this.

Let's do this brand.

Okay.

Let's see.

I just want to pull up the top of the top.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Let's see, we'll go to here.

Okay, so if you're actually running, then you can just grab some sort all your ads by, you know, spent or whatever has the best performance, and then pick those ones out.

For this, we're going to, we'll just go way back and find some ones that are still running.

So we got this.

Let's just copy this text.

I'll just copy all that.

And let's go back to cursor.

And here we go.

Let's do add number one.

Let's paste it in.

Then we'll go add number two.

So let's find three that are all a bit different.

So that copy's been running.

Okay, this one looks like this also has been running for a while.

So let's grab that.

Okay, there's a new one.

Okay, there's a new one.

And let's do test it a lot here.

Okay.

Let's see.

Okay.

Let's see.

Okay.

Looks like this kind of copy format there also run a good bit.

Good bit.

Good bit.

Good bit.

Good bit of.

So do add number three there.

And we'll just paste that in.

And then we're going to introduce you to the usage of an agent.

So let me make sure I'm all set up for that.

Okay.

So I am going to be able to do this.

And then we're going to be able to do this.

And then we're going to be able to do this.

And then we're going to be able to do this.

And then we're going to be able to do this.

And we want to do files.

We'll just do winning ads.

So we want to tag that file.

And we'll just say, analyze the patterns in winning ads.

And then let's add it to please provide those in a new file.

And we're using Sonnet, the newer one.

And make sure to click the agent option right here.

So the agent is highlighted.

And then we'll just hit submit.

Now, not every prompt works like we expect it to.

But that's fine.

It's very easy.

It's very cheap to try again.

So let's see what it came up with here.

So all ads lead with a strong hook.

Okay.

All ads use checkmark emoji bullet points.

Okay.

With three to four key benefits.

Great.

Promotion elements.

All discounts or sales.

Okay.

Call to action.

Urgency.

Social proof.

Warranty guarantee.

Key marketing angles.

Cool.

So.

That's pretty solid.

Let's see.

Now.

Let's ask it another question.

Let's see now.

Let's ask it another question.

In a new file, can you...

Let's see.

Analyze...

Analyze...

Which elements are in all three ads...

To create a winning ad baseline framework.

And...

We'll just make sure we tap the winning.

And...

Let's hit go.

Cool.

Cool.

Cool.

Cool.

All right.

So...

All right.

Great.

And the variation 2 worked the best.

Can you please come up with 10 new hooks for that ad?

Let's see.

Now to give some context.

We want to stop the scroll and grab attention.

Before you do that, Can you create a framework for producing high quality hooks?

Then let's use that framework to produce 10 variations of that ad.

So this is going to multi-step prompt.

That's what's really great about these agents that are able to take multiple steps.

I'm going to tell it, Hey, we launched them.

Variation 2 worked.

Let's create 10 new hooks for that.

But before that, We want to create a framework.

And we'll see what kind of framework it comes up with.

And then let's use that framework to produce 10 variations of that ad.

So what we're doing is now taking whatever context we've provided it.

And also that it has.

And whatever intelligence it does to think through those things.

It's going to create a framework for how to create good hooks.

And a new document.

And then we should be able to use that.

So we'll hit submit.

I want to see how that goes.

All right.

So look at that.

Look at the hook framework.

Boom.

Pattern interruption.

Emotional triggers.

Hook structure.

Power words.

Hook formulas.

Success criteria.

There we go.

There we go.

We're going to use that.

Pretty solid.

And now it's just there.

We can just reference that.

We can just reference that.

And then we'll see what the other thing is.

I can see what the other thing is.

We can see what the other thing is.

We can see what the other thing is.

We can see what the other thing is.

We can see what the other thing is.

We can see what the other thing is.

What if your wallet lasted forever?

Traditional wallets last months.

You spent two years crafting the perfect wallet.

Your wallet is costing you money.

Interesting.

Fresh to buy wallets.

I can't keep you up with your lifestyle.

Professional life demands professional gear.

So, yeah.

It took and made a variety of different hooks across.

So, 10 new variations from the winning ad.

Each using a different approach from the framework while maintaining the successful elements of the original.

Do you see how cool that is?

Like we're just having very simple conversation.

And we're doing quite significant copywriting work here.

And these may not be the most, you know, amazing copy.

This might not be something that if you hired a super expensive copywriter that they would come up with.

But I've been doing copy professionally for a decade.

And the reality is you might think someone's going to win.

And you know, it doesn't.

Something you don't think is going to win does.

It's really less of like quality shots.

Now, quality.

Maximize the quality.

Yeah.

But more on quantity.

And what we're doing here is other than getting one perfect thing is now in seconds, we can basically have 10 completely different things to test.

That's going to give Facebook a lot of, or whatever, ad platform, like a lot of options to now go find people that resonate with this.

And it might not be the most optimal performance for this particular concept or angle.

But you launch all 10 of these, you're going to see which one stands out.

And now you know which one to iterate on.

So I think that's pretty cool.

So hit accept.

And let's see.

Boom.

We're on day three.

We just finished that.

We've got the hook mastery.

As you can see, it's not super complicated.

It's just asking the right questions.

So let's say we launched all those.

Now we're testing some hooks.

Cool.

Match messages to buyer awareness.

Now let's say we want to iterate on one specific type of hook.

And so let's go in here and let's add the hooks into the context.

Now this is the agent.

It still has kind of everything in the context, but this is explicitly giving it the files when we ask it a question.

So we're going to say, Let's say we launched.

Yeah.

Let's say pain first promise.

Okay.

And I'm going to use my nice voice tool.

It makes it easier to write prompts.

So.

Okay.

Great.

So we launched all 10 of those hooks.

And the first one, the painter promise, worked the best.

So I want you to take that and then determine who, who's the audience demographic that we're speaking to in that.

And then I want you to break down inside that audience.

Break them out across the five different awareness levels.

Like what would be kind of the person's psychology or.

Yeah.

Ultimately, what we want to do is take that winning hook of the pain promise from the variations.

And then we want to create variations of that across all five awareness levels.

So we're using awareness levels, something from Schwartz, Eugene Schwartz, famous copy scientist.

And so we're going to saying, Hey, this one worked, taking it.

And now let's, let's now spread that across the different awareness levels.

And did it not even sometimes it doesn't.

Okay.

Let's try it again.

Hey, so we launched the, we launched a different awareness level.

The pain press promise hook.

So I want you to take that and then think about who's the audience that that's speaking to.

And then break that audience across the five different awareness levels.

And then from there, create two variations of that hook.

Speaking to each of the different awareness levels.

And you can be creative with the rest of the copy, but let's use variations of that kind of hook.

Across the different awareness levels.

Hopefully it records.

Maybe it's because I'm also using it to screen record right now.

We'll see.

There we go.

All right.

And I'll just do pink scrolls.

All right, cool.

So let's just see how it goes.

And if something doesn't work the way we expect it to, we can always go backwards.

You'll see if I go back to this previous prompt and I hit, you know, change, it will actually reset the entire thing back to that point in time.

So.

Look at that.

I'll analyze the pain problems hook, identify its core audience, create variations for each awareness level.

Like, yo.

I'm an expert and this would take me a lot of time and thinking.

Even if I could do it quick, it still requires a lot of thinking.

This thing is just like, boom.

And we're not even giving it like all the firepower we can.

We're just seeing, you know, with its kind of base training.

And these are already very intelligent models.

They're getting more intelligent too.

So.

Look at that.

Awareness level ads.

Boom.

All right.

So.

It identified as the quality focused professionals.

The most aware.

They know the product, ready to buy, needs funnel push.

Boom.

Look at that.

We got a basically a offer lead right there saying this is 40% off.

Variation two.

Cool.

Product aware.

If they know what you sell, but not yet convinced.

Okay.

So.

We're going to basically a offer lead right there saying this is 40% off variation two.

Cool.

Product aware.

If they know what you sell, but not yet convinced.

Okay.

So.

So.

We're going to do a little bit more.

We're going to do a little bit more.

And then we created a so in under 30 minutes, we took three winning ads.

And then we use that to create an analysis of the patterns inside the ads.

And then we went and created a winning ad framework that we could reuse.

We created a target audience brief of like three different demographics.

We created a product brief.

All the kind of sales points of the product.

Then we created 10 new variations of one of the winning ads.

And then we had it create a framework for how to create powerful hooks.

And then we use that framework to.

Create new variations of a winning ad of a winning hook.

To find, you know, 10 different new ways to open up the same kind of ad.

Then we told it, hey, okay, this is the hook that worked really well.

Let's go over and basically create two new ones for each awareness level.

All the way from most aware people who are ready to buy just need that quick push.

All the way down to people who don't even know that they have a problem.

Their wallet is something that falls apart.

And see, this is just single kind of problem solution.

And now we're broke it out across 10 different ads.

Pretty nifty.

Now the main thing is, look, this was one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

That was just seven prompts.

And we created at least 30 different variations.

Entire framework for how to do variations.

Your audience research.

Your hook frameworks, hook variations.

A brief on the product and the benefits and features.

And created variations for a targeted audience.

It's just, you see how easy this is.

You just, it's just connecting pieces and connecting dots.

Creating building blocks, giving it more context.

You know, sometimes it gets off the rails.

And then we can just revert back.

But that's basically, I hope you're kind of seeing the thing here.

And look, I just use ads.

That's all we gave.

Ads and a prompt.

We didn't even talk in, you know, having it search the web.

Or giving it existing frameworks.

Or even giving it a transcript of a course or a video.

Of somebody else's thinking.

And we created all this.

And under 30 minutes.

With just three ad pieces of copy.

And some props.

And it's just text.

It doesn't need to be ads.

We could do this for content.

We could do this for anything.

So, hope you're seeing the picture.

Hope this was helpful.

Hope you are seeing it.

Wow.

This tool is really, really cool.

Even though it's meant for coders.

I can see how useful it can be.

For all sorts of things in my business.

So.

Give us a shout.

If you have any questions.

If you run into any issues.

If you have any other things you'd like to see.

This is just the beginning.

I didn't do a whole deep dive here.

I just wanted to walk you through.

How to take some ads.

And basically multiply those.

Easily.

Quickly.

So that.

You can just have an endless amount of wonderful.

And powerful.

Strategically thought out.

Copy.

And not everyone's going to be a winner.

Not everyone is.

Even with the best copywriters. gonna be a winner not everyone is even with the best copywriters but the thing is here you can test widely you can test a lot of variables test different audiences then different hooks and then different awareness levels and all of these variables and instead of needing to think through and write it all or hire somebody to do all that boom you can just do it in seven prompts and under 30 minutes and if somebody you're paying somebody you know pay them a hundred hundred fifty bucks per ad so if we just made 30 plus you know boom that's a that's how you save three thousand dollars so thanks and I will see you around this has been Ryan Hunter with AG Antic Business showing you how to use this amazing tool to take some winning ads and multiply them into even more all right you Thank you.
