Use these bullet points anytime you need a deeper "About Ryan" section or to weave in authenticity and credibility in your marketing materials.

All right, let's update my backstory because this is getting it wrong. So look up the backstory doc, which is... What is it? It's about Ryan. Okay. all right oldest memory stake part computers my dad uh started programming at 13 taught myself python uh was a professional dj in high school went to school college for robotics engineering dropped out after a year to go learn about business land at a solar company that's where i learned about marketing i helped them modernize their entire marketing got the digital marketing set up all their ads everything website learned about marketing because it's leveraged and then copywriting even more leverage because you build assets that could run forever or for a long time and i always cared about leverage because i wanted to have time when i had kids and i wanted to have money and um went really deep into that uh reached a level of mastery with long form wrote long documentary style sales videos and scripts. Directed them for a lot of big brands, $100 million brands. Had my own DTC health brand supplement company. Always kind of was weaving my code through the tech thing, added some JavaScript to a page on a funnel that was spending 200k a month to make 2 million, and we doubled the conversion rate by getting more people to watch the VSL. So we cut CPA in half, doubled the conversion rate from 2 million a month to 4 million a month, same ad spend in like under a week. And then I worked at a brand that was spending over 100k a day across uh their ads profitably i ran the uh vsl script writing team there um continue to do all sorts of things i learned from some of the best in the world i've invested probably well over six figures into my you know learning from the best um and the last few years as i had my daughter i kind of stepped back went deeper into coding to figure out this ai stuff and uh i've reached a level of mastery where there's nobody doing what i'm doing and it's time to share that so that's more of my background update my about me and then go on and update the sales letter.
