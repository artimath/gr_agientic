## Part 1: Relevance and Elegance

**Big Idea must be Relevant and it must be Elegant.**

**The only goal of a Big Idea is: _Provide your prospect with a vehicle they CONNECT with and UNDERSTAND INSTANTLY_**

### Relevance

_• Something they can "unconsciously" relate to without a second thought_<br>
_• Relevance doesn't happen in isolation. Relevant ideas become irrelevant as the market evolves and vice versa. Everything that happens in your prospects' world impacts what is relevant._

## **The bottom line: is this something that will interest & connect with my market on first glance?**

### Elegance

- In my opinion, deserves more attention than relevance, because it's HARDER
- Big Ideas are NOT complex or inflated ideas (special warning to the "rising stars")

**The bottom line: is this something that my market will understand on first glance?**

**Goal: Find the sweet spot between the spectrum of Elegance and Relevance**

## Part Two: Only two kinds of big ideas...

**PROBLEM:** _Wading through the limitless possibilities is really damn hard_

### There's a simpler way...

_• If elegance and relevance are the LENS through which you look at Big Ideas, this next part will help you know WHERE to look_

- You either look deep **_INTO_** the product (Internal Ideas)
- Or... **_OUTWARD_** into the prospect's world (External Ideas)

_Both of these promos are about using your phone to make money in 2020..._

_Yet... Rapid Income Engine is an **INTERNAL IDEA**_<br>
_• It's all about the trading software which can be operated entirely from your phone, and the personal development story that brought it to life_<br>
_• This idea is based primarily from what's "inside" the product_

_Inbound Closer is an **EXTERNAL IDEA**_<br>
_• It's all about how a booming industry (online education) has created an opportunity to escape the 9-5 and make money from anywhere as long as you have a phone_<br>
_• The "booming industry" is about something "bigger" than the product_

**Internally-Focused Ideas:**<br>
When you have a product or concept that is truly unique<br>
**_When your market knows what they want to achieve and you have a unique way to get there (You can start to age in reverse with this simple trick revealed to treat the root cause of the aging body.)_**<br>
When you're in a "commoditized" product area<br>
**_When you have a really good "direct" narrative (Old guy who's sick asks healthy old friend his secret)_**<br>
When you have a noteworthy spokesperson or guru

**Externally-Focused Ideas...**<br>
**When you have a NEW discovery or opportunity (This clinically proven ingredient is known to reverse the core causes of aging)**<br>
When you are "creating" a problem<br>
When you have defined heroes and villains<br>
When you have emotionally charged events and cultural narratives<br>
When you market has known interests and "fetishes"

_Last: These are NOT mutually exclusive - you can find viable ideas in BOTH directions_

**What is the analysis of this product?**

**Internal idea:**

**Relevance:**<br>
**Elegance:**

In a Nutshell:<br>
The unique mechanism explains _why_ our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal... And _how_ they can overcome that problem.<br>
At its core, the unique mechanism is always a two-part logical connection.

The Reason It's Important:<br>
Typically by the time our prospect comes to us, they've tried numerous solutions to their problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, worked partially, or worked fully for a period of time (before they stopped working).

Our job as a copywriter is to educate our prospect about the REAL reason why past solutions didn't bring them permanent results. We do this by explaining that their knowledge about the problem is incomplete. They've been missing ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, and this "knowledge gap" is what's been holding them back.

There are two parts to the unique mechanism:

Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem our Prospect Faces.

Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution to that Problem.

It's important to identify the unique mechanism behind both the problem AND the solution.

_By showing the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why they've failed in the past._

_By showing the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed._

Typically there the unique mechanism is presented in one of two different ways: Problem -> Solution -> Avatar Created/Found Product That Matches Solution<br>
Problem -> Product Category Type Is The Solution -> Specific Product Is THE Superior Type of Solution

We will now look at both types.
