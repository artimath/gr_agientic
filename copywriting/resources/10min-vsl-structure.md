Big promise                                         | This is a 9 minutes long and it could possibly change your financial life forever. Just 90 days from today you could have a 700+ credit score, showing in your credit karma account. There is a little known, simple, but powerful method that is now being used by people just like you to raise their credit scores well into the 700s, and even 800 range... in as little as 90 days. It is the same secret I used to raise my own credit score from 541 to 756 after going nearly bankrupt and losing everything.

**Establish Authority**                             | My name is Jay Hannon, and while you probably haven't heard my name before... You've definitely seen some of the people I've helped, featured on CNN, Fox News, CNBC and MSNBC...after changing their financial lives forever. I am 40 years old, happily married and I live in a 4,000 sq ft house in the best part of town. I drive a top of the line Mercedes Benz - and it's all thanks to having an almost perfect credit score. The reason is because I have been able to do something none of the mainstream financial "experts" have been able to figure out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
**Big claim and pre-empt objections**               | This secret could potentially raise your credit scores into the 700s and even 800s with just one simple trick. It takes less than 5 minutes a day, doesn't require you to hire a high-priced credit repair agency or do anything illegal or unethical. In fact it has really no risk at all. And it's all possible because of a loophole I discovered in the credit laws of the United States that allows almost anyone, anywhere, regardless of credit score, income or education ... to follow 3 step-by-step directions and instantly be able to increase their scores practically "on-demand". It's like having a cheat code that lets you beat the credit system at it's own game - and there is nothing the banks, credit card companies or collection agencies can do about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
**Authorities smarter than you are doing it**       | This is the same exact secret being used by the "money managers" of elite athletes, entertainers, entrepreneurs, and celebrities... who get into financial trouble and need to rebuild their credit in record time... ...if I told you their names -- you would instantly recognize them... ...And until now -- they have been keeping it a very closely guarded secret. I discovered this by accident a few years ago when I was working in the credit industry and saw first hand how they were using this to raise their credit scores from 450s all the way up to the 700s and even 800s in record time. That's when I realized... the "experts" are all saying one thing publicly about how to manage your finances, but actually doing the exact opposite behind the scenes. This is how they can afford multi-million dollar mansions, countless cars, and secondary homes. As I dug in deeper, I learned there was a little known legal loophole that lets almost anyone who knows about it raise their scores very fast, in only 5 minutes a day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I estimate that this rare opportunity will only last another 12 months max before the politicians make some kind of law that closes it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**pre-empt objections/ know-it-alls**               | It doesn't involve complicated budgeting schemes, scrimping and saving, or coming up with thousands of dollars to pay off your credit card debts. I'm not talking about sacrificing your life to hand every dollar over to your creditors. And this has nothing to do with all the things most financial "experts'' will tell you to do to raise your scores. That's why it has only been known to a small handful of credit industry insiders... until now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
**Letting them in on a secret only the elite know** | And it's the reason this very unique and special kind of loophole is something that you've probably never heard about. All you need is your phone or computer and an internet connection, and by just following a simple step-by-step process in only 5 minutes per day, you can literally force your creditors to remove the inaccurate and negative items that are holding down your scores. This loophole is so powerful that the banking and credit card company lobbyists are working day and night to get our government to pass a law that prevents us from being able to use it because of how well it works. Can you believe that? This is because the banks and credit card companies around the world want to keep this once in a lifetime score-boosting opportunity a closely guarded secret for as long as they can... Because the lower your scores, the more money they make from you. I discovered this credit loophole being used by a small group of insiders by accident. And in addition to raising their scores, this little known "insider secret" is actually allowing these insiders to buy new homes, new cars, and take the dream vacations they've always wanted... Because when you have high credit scores, you can leverage it to set yourself and your family up for the financial future you truly deserve. Some are using it to invest in real estate, start businesses, and free themselves of their never-ending stress and worries about money. Let me explain and show you exactly how you can potentially raise your credit score into the 750s as well from the comfort of your own home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
**Discovery story**                                 | Thirteen years ago, a very significant little known "financial event" occurred. There was very little media coverage explaining the significance of that event. However, that event created a legal loophole so that people "in the know" could raise their credit scores into the 750s with just a little bit of effort, ...and, in turn - use that credit to acquire assets that allowed them to build their wealth. The richest people in America took advantage of this, which is why the wealthiest top 5% have increased their wealth more in the last 13 years than in the last 70 years combined! Think about this! This is also one of the reasons some US congressmen and Senators "magically" go from being on the verge of bankruptcy, to increasing their net worth up to $20 million within a few years after taking their oath of office. The super wealthy, and global politicians were using this legal loophole any time they needed a boost to their scores. The last time something like this occurred was when the US government formed the credit laws -- and shortly after, the banks and credit card companies became some of the wealthiest industries in the United States. When I became aware of this little known financial event and how things are really done behind the scenes, I also noticed that the rich kept getting richer and the poor kept getting poorer. The difference between the two was that the rich had access to cheap money because of good credit, and the poor had access to expensive money due to poor credit. Because when you have good credit -- everything in life becomes easier... ...You can get more houses for your money. ...You can get a better car for the same payment. ...You can get a better education with lower monthly student loans. ...The list goes on and on and on, while on the other hand if you have bad credit, everything in life either becomes expensive or unreachable. You are forced to settle for less, get crushed by denials and declines, And worse, the things you **_can_** get - you're forced to pay more for. I also discovered that every major bank in the world, and the biggest publicly traded companies, all without exception, made the most significant financial decision in the history of the world by latching onto this idea, and **using it to try and bankrupt the entire middle class.** Remember, the lower your scores, the more they make from you. So the banks and credit card companies are actively trying to get politicians to pass laws making it actually illegal for this loophole I'm about to share with you - to even exist. Because "they" want to keep you right where you are - stuck, and struggling. |
**Restate big promise**                             | But once you start using this little known loophole -- you'll know exactly how to turn any credit score in the 4, 5, and 600s -- into a 700+ score in as little as 90 days time. And the best part is -- there isn't a single thing they can do to stop you from doing it, or to stop me from showing you how. I'm exercising my 1st amendment right as an American - protected under the United States Constitution -- My freedom of speech is your financial freedom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
**Present the scarce opportunity**                  | Which means I can write a book about anything without anyone being able to stop me (for now) -- and that's exactly what I did. Not long ago I wrote a book and recorded some videos revealing this loophole in great detail. And showing how anyone can take advantage of it to change their lives for the better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Altruistic reason why**                           | The reason why I am sharing my knowledge and helping others raise their scores is two fold. First it angers me that the elite privileged ruling class of this world are greedy and want to increase their wealth and control by exploiting our hard work... ... using the majority of Americans as virtual slaves to debt and poor finances. By sharing this knowledge I am helping empower people to become financially free and independent and also take people out of their "trance" while teaching them to see how things really work behind the scenes of the financial world. Secondly, doing this is my way of "giving back" to society. The secret of living is giving. This act of selfless service and giving to people like you, I believe, creates amazing positive karma for me and is a way of planting seeds for my future prosperity. So here is what this will do for you today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Price Justification**                             | Normally, if we were to print this book and training program, and ship it to your door, it would cost us $297, which means we would have to sell it for at least $500\. But I'm not doing this for profit, Im doing this to change lives. I'm doing this so anyone who needs this, can have access to the information they need to change their financial lives for the better. And the only way I could think of that would let me do this -- was to offer it as a digital ebook and online training course you can view on your phone or computer as soon as you get access to it. So instead of a physical course for $500, you can get instant access to the digital version of the program for a one time payment of only $29\. You're saving $471 today, and also getting access to everything I've just shown you in just 3 minutes from right now. You'll join the thousands of others who are already using this to change their financial lives for the better. Now, think about it. What would this be worth if you could potentially save you hundreds, even thousands of dollars a year in interest and fees, that you're now paying to the banks and credit card companies? See, I know most people don't have $500, let alone $100 to pay this upfront. Even if you did, I want you to use that money to pay off your debt. So here is what I am going to do, for the next 200 people that accept this offer. You simply pay the $29 one time access fee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

So while you're with me, let me tell you a quick story. It's about a woman who's stuck in a flood. She's on her rooftop. She prays for God to save her. A boat comes by and says get in. She says no thanks. "I prayed to God. He'll save me." She says. I don't need your boat. The water is now up to her neck. Then a helicopter drops by. They throw down a rope ladder and say get in! She says no thanks. You can keep your ladder. I prayed to God. He will save me. And then...the woman drowns. She goes to heaven and is face to face with God Almighty. She says, God. I don't understand. I prayed to you. I believed in you. And yet you let me die. Where was Your help? God says: I sent you a boat and a helicopter. What more can I do? See, she didn't realize that her savior was right in front of her all along. And that's you. You're still watching this video instead of taking action. You think your savior may come from somewhere else. But you're here on this page. You're here for a reason. You invested a lot of time watching this video. You did that for a reason too. Of course, you could choose to ignore everything you've seen today. But think about this - If I'm wrong, you're out just a few minutes of your time and a quick email to cancel... But what if I'm right? God bless [timer]
