# I. What We're Looking For...

## Insights Into Demographic :

### **• Who Is Your Customer?**

### **• How Old Are They Typically?**

### **• What Attitudes Do They Have? (Religious, Political, Social, Economic)?**

Religious

-

Political

Social

Economic

### **• What Are Their Hopes and Dreams?**

### **• What Are Their Victories and Failures?**

### **• What Outside Forces Do THEY Believe Have Prevented Their Best Life?**

### **• What Are Their Prejudices?**

### **• Sum Up Their Core Beliefs About Life, Love, and Family In 1-3 Sentences.**

## Other Existing Solutions:

### **• What is the Market Already Using? (List Out)**

### **• What Has Their Experience Been Like?**

### **• What Does the Market Like About Existing Solutions?**

### **• What Does the Market Dislike About Existing Solutions?**

### **• Are Their Horror Stories About Existing Solutions?**

### **• Does the Market Believe Existing Solution Works?**

### **• If Not, Why?**

## Curiosity:

### **• Has Someone Tried to Solve the Market's Pain Points Before In A Very Unique Way?**

### **• What Was The Result?**

### **• Is There A Conspiratorial Story Behind Why Old Solutions Didn't Work?**

### **• Are There Any Older Attempts to Solve the Problem (Pre-1960) That Are Unique?**

### **• What Happened? Were they successful but forgotten? Or were they a failure? Why?**

Examples:<br>
1) Tesla in the energy space. Big energy didn't want his solutions, he was discredited and shamed. His inventions and discoveries were thrown into the ash heap of history until now.<br>
2) U.S. Army tried to cure foot fungus during WWII, surgeon general was on a desperate race because troops were missing service time. Finally succeeded by using Undecylenic Acid. But today we forget how effective it is.

## Corruption:

### **• Is There A Belief That the Market's Pain Point Used To Not Exist, Or Used To Not Be So Bad?**

### **• Is There A Belief That It's Been Recently Exacerbated By Outside Forces?**

### **• If So, What Are Those Forces And What's The Reason Behind Their Presence?**

**Mechanism Ideas:**

**Creative Ideas:**

**Great sources:**

**To review:**

**Swipe Examples:**

Examples:<br>
Diabetes and obesity used to be uncommon, but now they are common. People blame big corporations, processed foods, lazy Americans, sugar, etc. So many of these interests are commercial and greed that have forced or tricked people into an unhealthy lifestyle.

This isolated group of people doesn't struggle from whatever condition/pain point that most of us do. In America we DO suffer from this pain point. The reason why is that we are exposed to these outside forces while this isolated group isn't.

This renegade person doesn't suffer from the same pain point as the rest of us. The reason why is that he's managed to stay free from outside corruption, while the rest of us haven't.

# II. Where to Find The Answers to Our Research Questions?

## Forums/Reddit:

Look for replies vs. views. Why? On a post, if lots of people view it that's great, and there may be interest. But when there are a ton of REPLIES, it means people are really passionate, interested, and engaged.

Examples: <https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/28nuy3/a\_rant\_on\_the\_sad\_reality\_th> at_is_often_type_2/<br>
<https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/> <https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/> <https://bitcointalk.org/><br>
<http://www.personaldefenseforum.net/showthread.php?814-Venezuela-A-Case-for-Prepping>

## Facebook Groups and Pages:

Similar to forums. Pay attention to the posts with the most engagement. Not interested in a ton of "likes." Only semi-interested in a ton of "shares." Really interested in a ton of comments and arguments.

Example:<br>
<https://www.facebook.com/Diabetes-Support-119703998103102/?ref=br\_rs>

## YouTube:

Same thing again. I'd look for one that has a good amount of views. But then I'd also look at the engagement and comments.

Examples: <https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=bitcoin+conspiracy\&sp=CAM%253D> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8iBKbubCxM>

## Comment Sections on Articles:

And same thing again.

Examples:<br>
<http://www.breitbart.com/><br>
<http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/04/17/macron-europe-migration-destiny-africa/> <https://conservativetribune.com/>

## Authority Figures / Influencers:

Has Dr. Oz/Kim Kardashian/Oprah/Sanjay Gupta/Hot Lifestyle Model/Mommy Blogger/Whoever been discussing a specific pain point or solution?

We laugh at Dr. Oz and the free trial guys (and straight sale guys too) have kind of turned it into a joke. But at the end of the day if Dr. Oz is talking about an ingredient or a product, then most baby-boomers believe It must be the greatest thing since sliced bread.

When looking at an authority figure or influencer's website, article, Instagram post, blog, etc... Did they explain any science behind how the problem works, or how the product acts as a solution?

## Google:

It sounds simple but Googling the problem and solution is the best way to find information. Look at information from both Big Name sites and smaller ones. If you find something interesting, open a new tab, and start doing more research about it...

"How to" "How does" "What is" "Best ways to"<br>
"Natural ways to" "Why do"<br>
" Benefits"

## For Nutra:

Google: "Product name, humans, ncbi".<br>
Look for double blind studies and pay attention to dosages in there, and if the ingredients in your product match or exceed those dosages.<br>
"Meta-Analysis" articles are super useful too. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/>

<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609100/>

More Places to Go...<br>
• Examine.com (Go To Human Effects Matrix For Studies)<br>
• DrAxe.com<br>
• WhFoods.com<br>
• OrganicFacts.net

## Amazon.Com

No surprise here of course. But perfect for looking at similar products on the market, and reading reviews of them too. This works for both indirectly compete products, and direct competitors.<br>
• Look at 5 Star Reviews and 1 Star Reviews.<br>
• Look at the FAQs as this will help know what your market is wondering about.<br>
• Look at similar products customers have bought.<br>
• Look at product features/benefits/claims.

Examples:<br>
<https://www.amazon.com/Turmeric-Curcumin-Bioperine-Joint-> Relief/dp/B0112M60KI/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=hpc\&ie=UTF8\&qid=1523981225\&sr=1-1- spons\&keywords=turmeric+curcumin\&psc=1

<https://www.amazon.com/Penn-Plax-Aquaponic-Promotes-> Environment/dp/B012QGR2TC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8\&qid=1523981281\&sr=8- 5\&keywords=aquaponics

# III. IMPORTANT Notes:

## 1\. Through your research you'll typically end up getting the kernel for the mechanism behind the problem and the solution.

## 2\. If you find a unique solution to the problem, and your product fits it, don't be afraid to fit the two together.

For example:

If you have a weight loss product...<br>
And your product is geared towards helping with metabolism...<br>
You find a lot of research about how metabolism is governed by the thyroid hormone... You may want to bridge-the-gap, and have your product talk about...<br>
Which means making your copy about how a dysfunctional thyroid is the real cause of your poor metabolism.

## 3\. Rabbit holes are your friend (within reason). I've found some of my most interesting unique mechanisms and my best stories by going down rabbit holes.

Examples:

1\. Maybe you're looking at doing a DIY solar generator. You see someone's name as an early inventor of a prototype. You look into the prototype and find out it had a novel mechanism of action. That's all great fodder for copy.

2\. Recently writing a new offer for foot fungus. It has an ingredient called undecylenic acid in it. End up finding a U.S. Military Medical History about how during WWII, U.S. soldiers were PLAGUED by foot fungus. It was so bad it caused almost 10% of our soldiers to miss time in action. The U.S. Surgeon general at the time went on a desperate quest to find something that would control fungus. Ultimately they discovered that undecylenic acid was superior to all the rest.
