Yes, it is possible to see how much more valuable this is compared to a gym membership. The package addresses three main aspects:

- Solves all perceived problems (not just some)

- Conveys the conviction that what you are offering is unique (very important)

- Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offer with the competitor's

When creating offers, it is important that they provide a big emotional win right from the start. This will motivate them and keep them focused in the long run.

UNIQUE OFFER - superior, irresistible, with no room for doubt (no perceived risk)

Study the 4 to 5 best offers in each niche and see what works. Analyze all of them. Write down all the deliverables.

The best offers solve a problem with a solution. Identify the main pain point and solve it.

"How to win back your girlfriend/boyfriend" is a great niche.

Information products don't need to be super elaborate, just find that pain point and write about it.

The long-term plan is to conquer a broad market, develop a solid offer, build a contact list, and market additional offers to them.

To conquer a niche with 1000 buyers a day, you NEED to understand very well which offers are working in that niche. 4 to 5 offers that are successful. What they are selling, what the mechanism is, what the story is, how their sales funnel is set up.

When an offer doesn't scale in cold traffic, he starts by testing: 1) ads and 2) emails to ensure they are not the problem (the traffic sources). Then, 3) the lead and then 4) the average order value (usually the price of the first product).

Example in the relationship niche:

- Women want to find the right guy.<br>

- Women want a deeper connection with their partner.<br>

- Men want more options with women.<br>

- Men want to win over that girl they've always been interested in.

Installment Offer - payment plan.

Launch Offer - one-time early discount. Usually for the first buyers when they get a discount.

Exclusive Offer - offer only for certain people. You can add more bonuses, etc.

**Framing the Main Product**

Solving an urgent problem

An offer that causes an immediate positive reaction is aimed at a central desire that people are already spending money on.

An offer that causes an immediate positive reaction solves an urgent and pressing problem. Not a future problem. People care much more about the problems they are facing now.

Solution with the least necessary effort

People want a solution with the least amount of work/effort on their part. They don't want complicated solutions. The less work they have to do, the better.

The offer does not require the consumer to believe in themselves (low confidence)

The prospect has very low self-esteem in the area you are trying to help them with. Develop an offer that does not require much belief in themselves. You want your offer to require the least amount of self-belief possible.

Research says two things: a clear picture of the real problem people are trying to solve, but equally important, it gives a great idea of the frustrations and obstacles they encounter with the solutions currently on the market. Always be on the lookout for your market's problems.

Having a broad demand

You must create an offer that has BROAD DEMAND. Once you know what people are struggling with en masse and the problems associated with typical solutions, create the actual offer to target that person. Make sure to have a unique touch on the mechanism of your offer. Your offer must have a mechanism that your buyers have not seen before (it must give them hope that this is what was missing before).

Remove a key assumption

And if you create a mechanism that removes at least one key frustration that is universally accepted as something you need to do to get the result, even better. Look for something that removes a KEY FRUSTRATION and offers a clear path to get the result. These key assumptions made by your customer are what prevent them from getting what they want. If you can remove that obstacle with your product, suddenly all the things you gave up on in life will open up again. The initial offer needs to open that field for them.

The One Thing

People really want the "ONE THING." They don't want the entire "relationship bible" - they want the one thing that will fix their relationship, and it better be easy to do (or preferably done for them).

The most effective offers focus on the ONE THING that will bring the most dramatic result. ONE THING AT A TIME. If you can solve a key pain point and find a way to make your offer really solve it, you are facing a success.

Also keep in mind that the more points you try to address, the less effective each point will be and, therefore, your ad. An effective ad will have only one central focus, even if you discuss it from 2 or 3 perspectives. If your points are too diverse, they will compete with each other and end up directing the reader's attention in separate directions.

How to make your offer as DONE-FOR-YOU as possible

Another important key point is to relieve the pressure on the customer to get the result. This product needs to do all the work for the customer. Remember that they don't have much confidence in themselves. Make getting the first result as simple as possible. You want to reduce it to the essential parts that will bring a quick result.

Being (counter)intuitive

When I'm looking for the hook that will drive the offer, the one that always seems right is the one that's right under your nose, but it's a bit counter-intuitive, and that's why you didn't see it first. Offers that reveal the underlying truth that has been present all along are usually a success, because when the customer learns it, they think: "Oh, now I understand, now that I know this, I will move forward and succeed."

By doing this, they buy with great conviction, because it is so close to their life experiences and everything fits perfectly, changing their paradigm and making them see the world in a completely different way. It's like channeling an easy-to-buy belief into your product.

Try to position it as unique and irreplaceable

Most consumers don't know your competition. Be the loudest. Even if your product is not unique, your offer should be as clear as possible.

Making the product "irreplaceable"

The Scrambler does this very well: _"Now I recognized some of the techniques on the list over the years, but I could immediately see how using them in this specific order could completely capture a woman's attention and make her chase you." "It was a completely unique set of moves done in a specific order that work perfectly together to make a woman chase you and become completely engaged in being with you and only you."_

The Obsession Method: _"And this is not like all the other programs you may have tried before, this is not a program just about getting sex. It is a program for men who want to make women fully commit to them sexually and emotionally, and it is the only program that has true science and research injected into its DNA."_

**How to sell "boring" products**

A "boring" product is something that requires effort from the buyer. They need to do some work. This doesn't necessarily mean they are bad. How did the copywriter turn a "boring" product into something fun in Craig Ballantyne's Perfect Morning Sales Letter? He introduced something NEW into the mechanism - **Personalization.**

The presentation of the product is also very important. It was presented as a 21-day challenge... And that made the product EXCITING! That's what you need to do when you're selling a "boring" product... **Add EXCITEMENT to it.**

**Bonuses/Prizes**

As digital product sellers, one of the biggest reasons someone doesn't buy from us is because of the "will it or won't it" factor. This means they are still not convinced enough that what you are selling will work for them. And there is a very simple way to overcome this problem and convert more of these "undecided" prospects.

Solution: Add a bonus to your initial product/offer that only makes sense if your main product works.

Example: In the past, I sold list-building training, where I helped people build their own email list from scratch. A bonus I added to the training was a video on how to find the best products to promote to the newly created email list. Obviously, this bonus video would make no sense if my main product didn't work and they didn't build an email list.

By adding this bonus that solves the next challenge they face if my main product works, it makes them infinitely more confident in the main product.

"What could we include in this offer that will make prospects eager for it?" They have to take advantage of this opportunity just to get that 1 bonus.

- Use them to fill gaps in the product and remove excuses for not buying (your product may spark other needs/problems, so you need to overcome them).
- Instant gratification - something that offers immediate value.
- Irrelevant personalized prize (they perform great).

Sell these bonuses as intensely as the main product!

That said, there are some important things to remember when offering bonuses:

1\. Always offer bonuses (you can use the bullet point package we created at the end of Section III).

2\. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title.

3\. Tell them: a) How it relates to their problem; b) What it is; c) How you discovered it or what you had to do to create it; d) How specifically it will improve their lives or make their experience faster, easier, or with less effort/sacrifice (value equation).

4\. Provide some proof (this can be a statistic, a previous customer, or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable.

5\. Paint a vivid mental picture of what their life will be like, assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits.

6\. Always assign a monetary value to them and justify that value.

7\. Tools and checklists are better than additional training (as the effort and time are less with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation is still supreme).

8\. Each bonus should address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospects' minds about why they can't or won't succeed (the bonus should prove that their belief is wrong).

9\. This can also be something they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.

10\. The value of the bonuses should exceed the value of the main offer. Psychologically, as you continue to add bonuses, this continues to increase the discrepancy between price and value. It also subconsciously communicates that the main offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses, right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer extremely compelling).

11\. You can further increase the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonuses themselves (this takes this technique to another level).
