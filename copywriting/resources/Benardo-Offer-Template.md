**And perceives the reduction in effort and sacrifice.**

_Step #2: List all the obstacles they are likely to encounter along the way._

- Every complex step.
- Everything that happens before and after achieving their goals.
- What is the next problem they will face?
- What do they think they need to do to achieve the goal?

_Step #3: List all these obstacles as solutions._

- How can we make it worthwhile?
- How can we make it easier?
- How can we make it faster?
- How can we make it more enjoyable, sustainable, and something they believe they can do?

_Step #4: List all the different ways to present these solutions._

_Step #5: Narrow these down to only those that represent the greatest value and lowest cost to us. All we have to do now is..._

_Step #6: Bundle everything into a high-value final product._

**SPECIFIC RESULT IN A TIME FRAME WITHOUT THE MAJOR PAIN/FEAR**

Outline the Grand Slam offer here:

Macro, Micro Obstacles - Solutions<br>
_List the problems and excuses for each level: 1) dream outcome (Not financially worthwhile / too expensive); 2) likelihood of achievement (I won't be able to stick to it); 3) effort and sacrifice (Too long and confusing to understand); 4) time (Too much time to do it). Then, present a solution for each._

**Final Offer**

Products to deliver<br>
_What exactly will they receive? What are the features?_

Price and terms<br>
_What is the price and type of payment? List all payment options._

Awards/bonuses<br>
_What does the client receive that makes it irresistible? Try to add one that solves a problem after the desired solution; one that fills the gaps of the main product; and one for immediate gratification._

Risk reversal (guarantees)<br>
_Risk of financial loss (losing your money); Risk of "reputation" loss (losing spouse's trust, looking like a fool who should have done due diligence); Risk of time loss; Risk of inconvenience (having to change things, alter the system, etc.); Risk of unsatisfactory results; Risk of annoyance or intimidation (will I be contacted continuously? Will I have to change circuits to receive bonuses?)_

Reason to respond now<br>
_This is the justification for scarcity/leverage. Why do they need to act now?_

**--FRAMING–**

Solve an urgent and persistent problem with a BROAD appeal (ONE thing)<br>
_What is the urgent problem this offer is solving? Is it broad enough?_

Solution with the least amount of work possible (done for you, if possible)<br>
_How can I make it seem like this is super easy to use and the results are practically instant?_

The offer does not require the consumer to believe in themselves (low confidence)<br>
_Does this offer require the potential client to believe in themselves? If so, how can we eliminate that need for confidence?_

Remove a key assumption<br>
_What is the main frustration accepted as something the potential client has to do to get the result that this offer eliminates?_

The (counter) intuitive hook and analogy<br>
_What can you say that is a bit counter-intuitive but lights up a bulb in the potential client's head for being so intuitive? Something that goes against their beliefs but makes a lot of sense when they hear it. Think of "Eden Beauty" with the phrase "Your skin already has what it needs to reverse aging, just like it knows how to heal from a small cut..." Counter-intuitive hook + intuitive analogy_

The product is unique and irreplaceable<br>
_How can I make this offer seem unique and irreplaceable in the eyes of the consumer? They can't get it anywhere else._

How it works for everyone<br>
_People want to know if this will work for them. How can we eliminate anxiety and show them that this will work 100%?_

Dimensionalize the 7 deadly sins<br>
_If you ever need a quick and easy shortcut to get DIRECTLY into the secret desires of your market, all you REALLY need to do is think about the Seven Deadly Sins and see how they apply to your market._

- _Gluttony is about EXCESS with zero consequences._
- _Greed is status, power, and external self-esteem._
- _Sloth is about results without work, talent, or self-confidence._
- _Envy is a pain we want to stop at any cost._
- _O orgulho tem a ver com criar inveja nos outros._
- _A ira tem a ver com vingança, castigo, superioridade e raiva justificada._
- _A luxúria tem a ver com a satisfação dos instintos animais e com o facto de não nos sentirmos mais rejeitados._
