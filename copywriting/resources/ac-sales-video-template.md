# **Sales Video for Automatic Clients**

This is an extensive program designed to help you build a systematic machine that generates daily clients for your coaching, consulting, or professional services business.

## Opening

- Write an explosive statement / opening
- How to get 100-300 $5 sales a day and turning them into $5,000-$25,000 customers
- People realized that others were willing to pay $5,000-$25,000 for advice online, but getting those customers was near impossible
- Every few years there's a transition period.. 

  - Flip phones to smartphones
  - Gas cars to electric cars
  - Shopify
  - Bitcoin

- Transition periods can be good or bad 

  - Bad 

    - Toys r us

  - Good 

    - Netflix
    - Recognize transition point you can profit from that
    - We saw webinars were harder and harder to make work, we wrote a book and here we are

- So this video is not some webinar where we try to "break your limiting beliefs" and manipulate you into a sale.. We're gna show you what we did, how we did it, and how you can do it too.. And then if you want you can DL the PDF and set up a 5 minute call with us

## Transition into Introduction

- Robert backstory of trying to launch info business using webinars (3 separate types of webinars--all failed)
- Wrote book, posted on wall, made 6k
- How we met and how we started working on 2HA together (Robert was going to pay Alen for consulting but partnered instead)
- We made XX then died down and we had to rework the economics (to allow us to scale), mechanics and assembly...
- So let's discuss what that means exactly.. Economics, mechanics, and assembly.. Can you elaborate?

## Slight hint to the future

- Here's the bad shit that's already happening (the transition taking place most don't know about) 

  - Preframe question 

    - "How many people do you see starting businesses? How many of them are actually successful? The reason so few succeed is a massive transition taking place online right now that very few people are even aware exists - and ones that do are making MOST money online and are the typical success stories you see out there"

  - Facebook kicking your ass, costs going up 

    - Accounts banned
    - Ads denied

  - More and more competitors 

    - 800 people in your niche propping up
    - Influencers selling to your market

  - ClickFunnels sending tens of thousands of **funnelhackers** that copy you 

    - People are copying, spying on ads

  - Cost of advertising is going up due to supply and demand
  - Compliance is getting stricter and stricter 

    - (bitcoin, supplements, credit cards, loans)

  - Attention is decreasing as content output is outpacing content consumption 

    - If you want to sell $3k+ products you have to isolate attention.. Attention + isolation \= conversion

- Here's the bad shit that's going to happen 

  - Your market niche is going to get oversaturated
  - Ad costs are going to go up
  - The VALUE of your product /service is going to go DOWN as the competition continues to grow
  - People are going to copy your business overnight (there's even software for it)
  - Social media / ad network platforms are going to continue to get stricter (bitcoin, supplements, credit cards, loans)
  - Now...this might seem like bad news, but it's actually good news FOR YOU (because of what we're going to share with you in a few minutes) - if you identify transitional periods you can dominate / capitalize 

    - Steve jobs - iphone
    - Elon musk - tesla
    - Russell brunson - clickfunnels
    - Shopify

- Here's how the people that know what we're about to share will dominate 

  - Here's what we'll show you that will allow you to take advantage of all this and come out on top and why this is the best thing to happen to you...because this ONE thing gets rid of all your competition FOR you

## Explaining The Groundwork For The Opportunity

- What are the ingredients that make this possible? 

  - Level 3 customers help finance the campaign
  - Level 1 Customers (70% of your consumers) 

    - Very demanding
    - It's not part of their identity, it's just something they're trying out
    - Not much money money,
    - Low income
    - Difficult to work with
    - Don't take action
    - Complain
    - Will not spread the word
    - Very little revenue long term
    - Zero asset value to the business
    - Seek magic bullets and instant gratification
    - Will only spend $50-$100
    - Usually non repeat byers
    - Lots of customer service and hand-holding
    - Deflection of responsibility
    - 10-40% refund rates
    - A lot of competition for these customers
    - Level 1 customers rarely become level 2 customers
    - They don't understand the problem they have and need you to help them articulate it
    - System exploiters

- **Level 2 Customers (20% of consumers)**

  - Not fully committed
  - Hobbyist consumer
  - Dabbling with the idea
  - Don't have both feet in
  - Not after magic bullets
  - Not 100% committed to transformation
  - Possibility -> attainability
  - 50% deflection of responsibility
  - Will only spend $100-$1,000
  - Limited repeat buyers
  - 3-15% refund rates
  - Less, but more sophisticated competition than level 1
  - Level 2 customers can become level 3 customers if walked through the right process
  - They somewhat understand the problem they have but aren't convinced they need a solution for it

- **Level 3 Customers (10% of consumers)**

  - 100% Committed
  - Full mastery
  - Dedicated to transformation
  - 1-3% refund rates
  - Will spend $1,000-$100,000
  - They become not only evangelists, the become experts. People that lead their own local tribes, almost accidentally.
  - Repeat buyers
  - Very little customer service and hand-holding
  - Unlimited buying power dedicated to their transformation
  - Willing to perfect at the basics, intermediate and then the advanced
  - Very little competition for these customers
  - They are itching to spend money (but with the right person)
  - Trust
  - Authority
  - Certainty
  - Authenticity
  - They just need to hear someone articulate their main pain point. The one thing holding them back from a breakthrough. And then believe they have the answer
  - And the positioning and potent insights we put out will take care of the belief part
  - They know the problem they have and just need a solution to fix it and are willing to pay for it
  - Value builders

- The internet allows you to sell at scale
- FB - the rise of AI in ad networks - FB will go find customers for you especially when you're feeding 100-300 buyer data points everyday (1000+ with upsells) - they track everything
- Economics idea - with the right kind of offer you can dominate even with mediocre advertising.. You dont need to be a fb ads expert as long as the math of your offer checks out.. Math doesnt lie
- It's low risk

## How It Works (Case Study)

**Video 2:**

- Thanks and recap. Thank people for their comments and questions from PLC #1, and then give a quick recap of PLC #1\.
- Recap the opportunity. You won't spend as much time as you did in PLC #1, but you need to quickly recap the opportunity. Don't ever assume that your prospect has seen or paid attention to or remembered PLC #1\. Remember, they've got busy lives and your launch isn't nearly as important to them as it is to you.
- Recap your positioning. You need to remind them who you are and why they should listen to you. But don't take too long with this--do it quickly.
- Present a Case Study or do some real teaching. You need to deliver some real value for your viewer. Teach them one (or more) cool things that they can put to use quickly.
- Objection crushing. Talk about the top two or three objections and answer them. You want to go after your prospects' big objections to the change or transformation that you're promising.
- Foreshadow PLC #3\. You need to let them know you have another video coming soon. Build some anticipation for it by telling them a little about what you're going to teach in that video.
- Call to action. Ask for a comment on your launch blog or in social media.

**Video 3:**

- Express thanks and excitement. Thank your viewers for their comments and questions from PLC #2\. Tell them how excited you are and how excited all your viewers are. (And if you did a good job in PLC #1 and #2, then your viewers WILL be getting excited.)

- Quickly recap the opportunity and your positioning. Don't assume they remember (or even saw) your first two videos--briefly describe the opportunity, and remind them who you are and why they should listen to you. Don't take too long with this--move through it quickly.

- Possibly present a short Case Study.

- Answer the top questions you've been getting. In other words, you're going to answer the top objections. You want to do this even if you've already raised and answered those objections in your earlier PLC. People raise the same objections in different ways by asking different questions. So go ahead and answer those questions that keep popping up in the comments on your blog.

- Explain the big view and how to make it happen. This is where you step back and look at what's really possible. What's the ultimate transformation or change that your prospect can have in their life if they buy your product? Look at it from all angles and project out into their future.

- Pivot to your offer and create a soft landing. Do this in the last 25% of your PLC #3\. By now your prospects have fallen in love with you, because you've given them huge value. And it's time for you to start preparing them for the offer--that's the "soft landing." You don't want to go from being their best friend in one video to a used-car salesman in the next. So you have to tell them that in your next video you're going to have an offer for them, and they need to watch if they're ready to take their transformation to the next level.

- Seed the scarcity of your launch offer. You will want to have some type of scarcity in your launch offer, and near the end of PLC #3 you want to make some mention of that scarcity. You're not looking to hit them over the head with it, because they still haven't seen your offer. But this is a good time to mention that they should be on the lookout for your next email, because this is going to be a limited offer.

- Call to action. Ask for a comment on your launch blog or in social media.

**Video 4:**

- Express thanks and excitement. Thank your viewers for their comments and questions from PLC #2\. Tell them how excited you are and how excited all your viewers are. (And if you did a good job in PLC #1 and #2, then your viewers WILL be getting excited.)

- Quickly recap the opportunity and your positioning. Don't assume they remember (or even saw) your first two videos--briefly describe the opportunity, and remind them who you are and why they should listen to you. Don't take too long with this--move through it quickly.

What if everything you know about selling online is not only outdated but dead wrong...

And how would I prove that to you?

Well first off...you're on this page, so that's half of it.

The second part's here on this page.

Here's waht's going on...

**Parking lot**

- What happens when everyone does the same thing? everyone gets the same result
- Given this, what's everyone doing wrong? 

  - Good math can make a shitty business work
  - Bad math can't make a great business work
  - You can't fix a business with advertising, only amplify it

- What's currently wrong with how everyone is doing things
- Why information vs ecom, amazon, etc...
- How are things going to change, talk about porn industry, infomercials, ecommerce, etc...
- Production and consumption of content
- Facebook & Google algorithms
- You can build a 7-figure business if you understand economics, mechanics and assembly (it's actually a tiny business in the grand scheme of things)

- This creates an opportunity for you and how it works

- Why FB marketers are full of shit...80% of the work is done by AI
- If you can acquire customers at break even from these platforms you can just keep profiting
- Until now...there was a SLIGHT hint of this going on with WEBINARS...webinars got one thing right, back end economics, they fucked up FRONT end completely
- No barriers to entry, prices go up, the model collapses

- Cash conversion cycle sucks - With webinars you gotta spend 2-5x of the price of the product to know if it works or not

- Macro scale
- Robert wrote a book in 2 weeks and made $6k
- Micro scale
