**REMEMBER: The BEST CONVERSION TOOL IN THE WORLD is...**

![][image1]

**Who are you writing too? (Must be able to point a finger to the person.)**

Male entrepreneurs, most likely over 30 and already successful or are quite clearly going to be. They make more than $100K/year. Most of them a lot more. They work mostly online and spend most of their time in front of a computer. They live on their own - most likely with a girlfriend or wife. They're interested in spirituality, and some more esoteric topics. They've either tried or practice meditation regularly. Whilst they are driven in their business, they find themselves frustrated with their general level of health and fitness. They're into self improvement and have tried numerous nootropics which don't seem to have a lasting effect.

**What's their PRESENT PAIN(s)? (FINGER POINT to Hell Island symptom?)**

They have a few habits they just can't seem to shift - even though they know exactly _what_ to do. Or, they're trying everything under the sun to lose weight/put on muscle/sleep better etc. but nothing they do works. They've noticed their energy levels start dipping. They don't recover quite as well from a night out as they used to. They also notice they're not quite as mentally sharp as they were before... projects seem to take longer, they don't remember things quite as well, they're not as decisive as they used to be.

They rely on willpower to "brute force" their way to the gym. Their diet is a constant battle. They hate tracking everything. They need to force themselves to go to sleep in the evenings.

They understand the link between fitness, energy and cognitive performance at work - but don't understand how to tie everything together. They've actually already tried quite a lot to fix it - but nothing's ever stuck for them. They've bought new fitness trackers, tried new morning routines, got weird orange glasses to wear which their girlfriend hates, had some blood work done and probably tried keto and crossfit. But, despite all this effort their symptoms still get progressively worse.

They experience Cognitive Lag. One of the main things they've relied on throughout their career - intelligence, creative thinking - is starting to drop off. So is their energy.

**They're also extremely frustrated by the fact they can't figure this out. They identify as a successful, intelligent person... and hate the idea there's a part of them which they can't shift to achieve what they want to. It's limiting their choice and freedom - which is part of their motivation to be an entrepreneur in the first place.**

They know that this is progressively getting worse - after all, they're not aging backwards.<br>
They keep putting it off as a priority, as there's several things they know they _could_ do to fix this, but they all seem to require a lot of time and energy they would rather spend elsewhere.

But... they also know that if they "don't have energy", or "don't have time" to fix it now... it's also the easiest it's ever going to be for them as time isn't slowing down.

Their personal HELL is not being able to enjoy the fruits of their labour, once their success is locked in.

Or maybe... never achieving that in the first place. After all, whilst they're currently successful it's not _assured_ for the rest of their lives.

All their plans for hobbies, adventure, success... are ruined by poor health.

Maybe they want to start a pet project on something they really love. But they're not thinking as clearly, they can't take in information as well as they used. Worse...they just don't have the energy to do it.

Their relationships suffer as they use up all their "spark" and "zeal" on a business project... which could have been completed MUCH faster and more efficiently if they knew how to improve their health.

They spent all that time, energy, money, so they could finally "do what they love", only to find that at the end, they're just not quite who they used to be.

Ask yourself: would you rather be a multi-millionaire, with the energy of a 25 year old and the clarity of a 40 year old... or _just_ a multi-millionaire?

Or neither...

In addition, they are also looking for the "next level", or something that is more meaningful to them. They can't quite put their finger on it but something feels a little "off".

**What do they WANT(s)? (FINGER POINT to Heaven Island Vision?) (e.g. what do they WANT? Primary goal, secondary goal 1, secondary goal 2, secondary goal 3**)

They want to know their issues with health and fitness, cognitive performance, stress, energy are taken care of... primarily so they won't get any worse.

They want a plan which they can follow that covers _everything_, in the right order so they don't have to spend endless hours researching everything and confusing themselves.

They want to be able to spend their energy on their business, rather than having it leaking out in random places.

They have more status in their community and with peers - because they're company runs more efficiently, makes more money and because of their leadership and vision, is doing things the competition simply can't see.

People look up to them.

They see their purpose as a shining example to follow.

And that purpose... comes directly from understanding the real reasons why they're doing what they're doing.

They feel secure that their greatest asset - their mind - is operating at its full potential.

And this isn't to mention the improved relationship with their other half... or maybe the fact that women (or men) look at them a bit differently now since they radiate energy and look better.

They feel good about themselves.

They know who they are.

They feel a sense of freedom and choice in understanding how their mind works, where their blindspots are, what to do about them and that they know they have enough energy to take care of all their problems and their family's.

**_They're comfy in their own skin and their own heads._**

Primary Goal 1: Freedom, choice, confidence

Secondary Goal 1: More energy<br>
Secondary Goal 2: Less stress<br>
Secondary Goal 3: Cognitive Performance<br>
Secondary Goal 4: Plan of action & understanding of root causes

**What STOPS them from escaping hell island and getting to heaven island? (FINGER POINT?)**

They don't know what to do fitness-wise

They haven't got time

They don't have the energy

They don't have the consistency

They try to keep healthy but are held back by bad habits and vices

They constantly over-eat at weekends, or on holidays

They're too stressed so they can't lose weight

They've got analysis-paralysis

They don't know who to trust

They've failed so many times before trying to reach their goal

They don't want to sacrifice work and time spent at work

Friends will laugh at them

Friends constantly drag them back, or offer them things to tempt them

**What have they tried before? And, what DON'T they like about the options available now to get from hell to heaven? (FINGER POINT?)**<br>
KEY TO EASY CONVERSIONS: What are they **FED UP WITH** SPECIFICALLY (finger point) which this offer gives them a "way out'?

Personal Training → doesn't deal with their root causes, constantly rely on PT for motivation, ongoing expense

Different workout programs → nothing "sticks", no actual solution, constantly searching for something new

Nutrition plans → rigid, boring, require lots of attention to adhere to, annoying when socialising and going out

Different diets → never seem to quite "hit the spot", constantly changing, again - not a real solution

Running → repetitive, get injured easily, cold and wet outside

Just doing 10K steps per day → doesn't really feel like it's doing anything; only exercise

Group coaching → not enough focus on their specific problems

Getting more fitbits and wearables → data helps, but often conflicts with what they know to be true about how they feel; data can't stop them from binge-eating and drinking on the weekends

Willpower → finite; feel like a failure when it doesn't work; start to internalise these failures as character deficiencies

Relaxing more → find it hard to relax to alleviate stress; constantly thinking about what needs to be done;

Self Improvement books → give a short term dopamine hit and then nothing; nagging feeling they're not fixing shit

Listening to affirmations → feels hollow, empty; affirmations aren't really theirs; feels like installing a trojan horse inside their mind simply to do something they want to and _should_ be able to do

Podcasts → same as books, really just infotainment

Going on Twitter → lots of useful information but hard to tie it all together

So, having tried all this they just... accept it's "who they are".

**What's the NEW PLAN we're giving them? (FINGER POINT? Make sure the plan doesn't require INTERNAL CHANGE. Need a mechanism or tool.)**

The New Plan only requires one thing - to accept that they _are_ leaving a lot on the table when it comes to both their health and potential.

But...

Once they admit that, we can help them _a lot_.

We give them a training plan tailored to them and their goals which _will_ work if followed.

Same with nutrition.

Same with sleep, supplements etc.

And then, we give them tools to make sure they stick to the program.

And a framework for helping them to follow it.

We teach them how to control their emotional states and get habits under control so sticking to the program isn't a monumental sacrifice.

Then... once we've got the surface-level states and behaviours under control, we dive even deeper, to understanding where they came from.

And that's where we use depth psychology and hypnotherapy to re-orient the story they're telling themselves and start writing a new one.

One that's got their health, energy and stress on autopilot, with a clear direction of where they want to go long term.

Result?

They don't _need_ motivation to do these simple health and fitness things because they've cleared out all the bullshit around these simple tasks.

**How QUICKLY can they start to see results? What's the FIRST goal we want them to achieve/experience? (E.G Make $1,000 a day in profit... THEN $100k/mo)**

First goal - that they understand the concept of their habits being due to their own psychology and therefore if we can build a picture of how this works, we can change them.

Then... showing them they can communicate directly with their unconscious mind to change things _and_ control their emotional state which leads to their most prominent destructive habits.

They can expect to experience that within 1 - 2 weeks.

**What's the ONE THING they need to believe to be certain the NEW PLAN will work for them?**

That they are capable of using their mind for change.

**What's the FUTURE PAIN they will experience if they do not solve the problem and get off hell island? (FINGER POINT?)**

Forced to accept that their issues are just:

"Who they are"

"It's not that bad"

"They should be grateful"

Whilst knowing they're leaving their potential on the table...

And year by year it's going to be harder and harder to reclaim it.

"But that's life"

"Oh well..."

This is the exact opposite to the type of person they know they are deep down.

They don't settle in other areas of their life...

So why here?

They know that's true... but they can't fix it.

So...

They carry on like they are now, resentful of themselves - which might come out in other ways.

Towards friends, family, relationships, kids.

**How do you get your client's results?**

We use hypnotherapy and psychology to remove the emotional blocks preventing them from making progress in certain areas of their lives.

We can also use blood work and lab testing to verify _exactly_ where their physiological issues come from meaning their plan is _perfect_ for whatever issue they're facing: this obviously adds cost.

**In Star Wars, Obi Wan's plan for Luke was to become a Jedi and overcome the Final Empire. SO, what is your plan for Luke? (Find what's different)**

To become a business Jedi and rid the world of dull, impactless companies one exit at a time, building a network of entrepreneurs in the process that work on the real, important stuff we need.

**How would you draw the before/after/mechanism transformation picture?**

Imagine a river, with a bank either side.

Each bank represents one component of your mind - unconscious and conscious.

There are people on both sides of the river, trying to cross both ways. Without being able to cross, they can't trade with each other so that both sides can perform their jobs properly.

So, they build a bridge. Due to the sometimes torrential currents of the river in between, the bridge is built so it can rotate and "roll with waves".

But... due to some unforeseen event, it gets stuck in a weird position, meaning people can no longer cross from one side to the other easily.

Thus, in order to get through, they using all sorts of ridiculous workarounds like zip-lines, swimming, building canoes... wasting a lot of energy and losing lots of their resources in the process.

That's the before picture.

The after picture is that we come in, fix the bridge and get it back to allowing people to cross easily and freely - i.e. we remove the friction between the conscious and unconscious mind, so that our client's behaviour simply aligns with what he wants, rather than it being a battle in the area of his life he's struggling with.

**What's the IVQ statement?** (Investment. Value. Qualifier. EXAMPLE: The investment in Big Ticket Email Mojo is $6,000\. Most of my clients make that back in 6 emails give or take as long as they've got 500 openers and at least a $500 product.)

Investment: £1500

Value:

Qualifier:

**List as MANY objections to the PLAN as possible:** (Remember objections fall into 5 categories: T.I.M.E.R: Time, Identity, Money, Energy, Reputation.)

**Time**<br>
"I don't have time for this, it's an hour every week with no guaranteed change"<br>
"I need results now - there's XYZ program that promises them within 7 days"<br>
"I might resolve the habits, but the change I'm looking for could take months or years after"<br>
"I'll feel like I'm faking it til I make it for ages"<br>
"I'm going to have to follow this program _forever"_<br>
"I'll constantly have to watch my back for it to come back _forever"_

They can have this result in 6 weeks:

- Habits embedded
- Patterns resolved around the behaviour
- Removed the negativity from their self-concept
- More clarity on what they want from their biz
- More energy
- Less stress
- Better decisions

**Identity**

"I'm just not a fitness guy"<br>
"I'm not a gym-bro"<br>
"I've tried health before and it didn't work"<br>
"I'm a rational, skeptical kind of guy; hypnotherapy isn't real"<br>
"I don't need help - I'm a successful guy I work things out myself"<br>
"I'm a _grinder_ - I just need to grind through this problem like everything else; it works"<br>
"My peers aren't in shape and they aren't struggling with issues like me. Doing this will make me less like them... _less part of the tribe_"

This improves their identity. It helps them become more of who they know they are deep down, but somehow keep sabotaging and getting in their own way.

The issue here is... most out of shape people are, by definition, _not_ fitness people.

They also may feel like getting in shape puts them "out of the herd" when it comes to their peers.

**Money**

"It's way more expensive than a PT"<br>
"I can get a self hypnosis app for $10 a month"<br>
"What if it doesn't work?"<br>
"I have to buy loads of other stuff as well - gym membership, blood work etc."<br>
"It's too expensive for what it is - you just talk to me for an hour a week"<br>
"I could go to a therapist for less"<br>
"I can do bloodwork myself"<br>
"Nutritionists cost less"<br>
"I can't measure my improvement in money"

£1500 - there isn't really a solid, quantifiable outcome I can use for this.

With a money back guarantee if you don't get the results you want

**Energy**

"I still have to do the program myself"<br>
"I have to fill out all these forms"<br>
"I don't have the energy to maintain change"<br>
"I'll have to do all this myself after we finish working together"<br>
"I've tried _so hard_ to sort this already... this can't be any _easier"_

Downside to this program is that they have to put in work. Change isn't easy - especially lasting change.

BUT

The amount of energy they put into this, is insignificant compared to the amount of energy they're wasting on poor habits, leaving on the table from not being in shape and having their mind pulled in a hundred different directions.

Think about this...

People generally don't get in shape because it takes a lot of energy, it's confusing and it takes time.

It's not just the energy of working out.

You have to know whether what you're doing is correct.

In order to do this you have to hire someone or educate yourself.

You then have to be able to see all the things you can't see, which are effecting your performance.

These are your blindspots.

By definition they're extremely hard to see.

They're parts of you that act as defense mechanisms and keep themselves hidden... so they can keep on protecting you.

Uncovering them yourself takes _a lot_ of hard work, awareness, and most importantly _time_.

Which is something you already didn't have before you even discovered the concept of a blind spot.

So now you have all these things stealing your energy:

1. Willpower to not cave to your old habits and vices
2. Willpower to embed your new habits
3. Confusion around what you actually need to do
4. Confusion around what's _most important_ for you to do
5. Old narratives around "it's just who I am", "I've tried before", "it just doesn't work"
6. Past failures

PLUS

All these blindspots you can't even see.

Working with us, we take all of that away - the only energy you need to put in, is showing up to the calls and doing the things we put in your Treatment Plan... which is _a lot_ less than what you'd have to go through if you did all that on your own.

Think about some of our clients. They've literally spent _years_ trying to solve some of their habits: drinking too much, agoraphobia, "laziness", lack of energy... and we've done it in 6 weeks.

**Reputation**

"People will think I'm crazy for seeing a hypnotist"<br>
"People will laugh at me if it doesn't work"<br>
"People will think I'm stupid for believing you - you're not a doctor"<br>
"If this doesn't work, my business might get worse - then I'll lose my reputation"<br>
"People will think I've become one of those fitness-freaks and start to think I'm strange"<br>
"I can't start talking about the power of the mind and all that nonsense, people will think I've lost my business mind and can't think properly"

Doing this will make you _look_ good, and make you look _good_.

Most fitness habits are driven by emotional patterns we can't even see.

Inconsistency is a habit, not a character trait.

Once you can start to unpick these patterns in one area of your life - you'll start to notice how they impact other areas, too.

So it won't just be your energy, looks and clarity that'll improve your reputation.

There will be a lot of other positive changes too.
