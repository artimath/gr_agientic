**THE ILLUMINATI SYSTEM 1.0**<br>
**![][image1]**<br>
**By Father Freedom**

**My Two Goals For You**

1. **Lotsa Money**
2. **High Status**

**What I am going to teach you today I did organically on Facebook but the system applies to any social network**

1. **Lotsa Money**

2. **Learn to get fully comfortable asking for money**

3. **Without it, momentum is difficult - competing is hard**

4. **You don't need to monetize your audience directly**
5. **Cash flow allows you to serve properly**
6. **When you show up with the right vibe, you inspire people**
7. **If you want money but can't get it, you develop resentment**

**2\. High Status**

- **It's the only way to be taken seriously**
- **Regulates your emotions and hormones**
- **People beg to work with you**
- **Gives you authority - people take your lead**
- **High status people are automatically attracted to you**
- **People introduce you to others**
- **People want to give you money to thank you for inspiring them (JBP Patreon)**
- **Everyone wants to help your mission**

**We don't want high status everywhere. We want to pick a very defined group of people to be high status to.**

- **Geography**
- **Industry**
- **Job title**
- **Worldview**
- **Skill**
- **subculture**
- **Or any combination of the above. *The more you combine, the more you shrink your pond size but the faster you become the big fish**

**Be careful of receiving constructive criticism from people who haven't constructed what you are constructing.**

**How well do you believe something? To what degree are you willing to stake your life on it. How bad do you want this?**

**In order for me to Create a proper formula, I had to understand the value of hierarchy**

**Hierarchy**

I've become obsessed with hierarchies lately. I believe they are more important than we can even conceive.

In order to take action in the world, we must organize our perceptions into priority order. We have to value rank one thing over another. Even getting out of bed in the morning, you have a hierarchy of what you value.

Checking Facebook vs going for a walk.<br>
Brushing your teeth before or after you shower.<br>
Breakfast before or after you go to the gym.

Everything we do is sorted based on how much we value it. Otherwise we couldn't act. If you couldn't place value judgements. That's why when people say don't be judgemental, we can't not. Comparison is built into us. We do judge books by their covers.

You can't even organize your perception without hierarchical structure. Hierarchy even exists on the level of every action you take. You decide that that thing you are going to do or even look at, is the most important thing you could be doing in the world right then. So we can't escape it

**<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXxKBiidbeo>**

**Lobsters**

Lobsters are hierarchical and territorial.

Their brains share neurochemical similarities with us. There is a neurochemistry of victory and defeat. And it is reflected in their relative postures.

Serotonin<br>
Octopamine

A winner has high S and low O.<br>
A loser has low S and high O.

High S gives the lobster a tall, spread open posture, a cocky strutting shellfish. On the flipside, a high O lobster is drooping, folded in, scrunched up. A low self esteem meek lobster.

It turns out prozac raises serotonin in the lobster and it transforms their behavior. A low serotonin lobster has a low tolerance for stressful situations, danger, and threat.

**Unequal Distribution In Nature**

And I've noticed that in order for a system to work in the best way, there needs to be a foundation. That if you skip steps, the entire building you build upon is shaky. And that attempting to move on up the hierarchy without sorting out the foundation, can lead to collapse.

More plausible, and were talking about getting known on Facebook as an authority, you just look delusional for skipping steps. Think maslow's hierarchy of needs.

![][image3]

Anyone know someone living up here who can barely wipe their ass? Pseudo spiritual people. Trying to skip the work and go straight to enlightenment. All tree, no roots. Exactly. This is like so many of the coaches in the coaching space. They haven't sorted themselves out yet. They have appointed themselves authorities without anything to back it up with. Some of you here have that problem and you need to get some more roots. Some of you have the opposite problem, you are all roots and no tree.

Now. I've only been actively building my name in this industry for 4 years. Been preparing for this for 12\. I'm not like the ultimate authority on this. However, as you see, I've built a brand that is skyrocketing, and even back in 2015 when I had a following of like 500 people, we were doing 20 to 70k per month. So I'm telling you, don't let the size of the boat fool you here. It really is the motion in the ocean.

Everything I've done has been deliberate. I've stood on the shoulders of giants here, no man is an island. I've watched and studied. Dan Kennedy and Jay Abraham have been big influences on me. And WWE. And rock stars.

I'm going to show you how to become larger than life. And make no mistake, this is what you want to become. The vast majority of people on earth do not want to follow the rock band that are boys next door wearing the same clothing and style they are.

People generally don't believe in themselves and need you or Jesus or a system to believe in until they can believe in themselves.

I've been putting together a formula. A road map for this. It's always evolving and I'd like to give it to you today. My life's work in this area up until now. I have brand new copywriting formulas and processes that nobody else taught me and one day I'll share em, but this whole positioning/personal branding, becoming an authority thing, I'd like to share my contribution to our industry.

**One way to think about my system is that for the first time ever, you'll have a systematic way to troubleshoot your own level of influence, authority and position.**

You'll know what is most important at any one moment in time. You'll know exactly what to work on, what's missing, and where you are at. This kind of monitoring system has never been available to us before.

The real secret is you don't usually do one or two big things, barring some media or publicity fluke, but 100 things done in concert with each other. These are the nuances that make the difference. This is because we make our judgements on intuition.

**My system has 3 parts to it**

**1\. The pyramid**<br>
**2\. The New World Order**<br>
**3\. The Central Bank**

This morning we will be going over numbers 1, and 2\. The Central Bank is all of the little miniature business models I told you about in the sales copy for this event. This is the "how you turn it into money" part.

The pyramid is the 30,000 foot view formula for marketing yourself on social media so you are never lost again. You'll now get it. And know why you haven't been getting traction.

The New World Order is the What to do on a daily basis. What do you actually do.

**The Pyramid**

**![][image4]**

People talk about "giving value" but it's elusive. Well, here it is. The entire pyramid is what constitutes value to people

This is the foundation, but do not ever forget you are an entertainer first.

**Authority \= Status**

**Status is how much social value someone holds in an agreed upon setting.**

**If you don't have status, you won't be taken seriously.**

Is survival, especially the way we are wired. Low status is a BIG risk - of illness, attack, depression, and low quality mates (thus a higher chance of not passing on good genes). We are fucking wired to gain as much status as possible.

When I see people online trying to be influencers or gain authority, I really see it as trying to be high status. But not only can I see them from a high up big picture snapshot of their overall status, but every behavior becomes a telltale signal in and of itself.

Everything is either a DHS or a DLS. This is a question you always want to ask. Is this something a high status person would do or say? Or low status?

Neuroendocrine reactivity is a signaling system that informs a person (and others) of his or her relative status: how you feel tells you where you are in the social hierarchy and how you react to social stressors, informs others of your status as well.

The relationship between status and the neuroendocrine system seem to be bidirectional. Not only does perceived social status influence hormone levels, but changes in hormones can change an individual's perceived social status and therefore, how he interacts with the world.

What makes people higher status than others?

**Nature favors those who have social and political intelligence.**

This means

1) Being smart to learn the implicit rules that constrain behavior in the particular group and monitoring adherence to them while knowing how to step out of it sometimes

2) Forecasting and influencing the behavior of others

3) forming powerful alliances based on reciprocal obligations.

A specific social hierarchy is basically a set of social norms, that is, rules that constrain behavior of individuals depending on their rank.

High status individuals typically take on the role of enforcing these implicit social norms, aggressing against those who break em, and breaking up disputes between lower ranking individuals.

The single most common cause of aggression in primate societies is the perceived violation of the social code.

To be of high status is to have priority of access to resources in competition.

Look at political orientation scales that measure social dominance. People who score high on measures of social dominance tend to prefer hierarchical relationships, distribution of resources based on merit, conservative ideology, military programs. These are all consistent with MAINTAINING priority of access to resources.

This kind of thing has been replicated in contrived social experiments. Ascribed arbitrary social rules and asked to enforce them. Adults are far more likely to look for violators of the rules when they believe they are monitoring people who have LOWER status than them.

Social dominance \= deceptive ability and ability to decode nonverbal cues, that is, deceiving others, persuading others, and guessing their intentions.

A major outcome of these deceptions is breaking social norms without getting caught - an effective strategy for lower ranking individuals to improve their access to resources.

It's difficult to dominate those who can outwit you.

**Look on this pyramid and notice where most people want to begin. Up at the top.**

They want to just start posting shit, and I'm not saying you shouldn't. Always take action. I'm saying, the power is down here, and that is where the real work is done.

The attention/status link

People pay attention to the highest status people. In nature, a chimp was so weird looking, all the other chimps were staring at him and he rose in status

Building authority always starts with you.

**You**

What is your role?

Knowing how you fit into an archetypal role, will help you see where you fit into the lives of your audience. You need this for clarity and to bring yourself out of your shell more and be larger than life.

Straying or not knowing your role to your market can cause problems. Much like the mother who feels clouded on her role as a mother so becomes like the "bff" of her teenage daughter. The roles get blurred and cause issues.

Good thing is humans are pretty damn predictable. There are clues to your role. One trick is looking at who your biggest influences are now and when you were growing up and truly ask _why_ are they your influences?

Clue: Write down and ask - what character traits do I admire about them?

What competencies do I admire about them? If you had to introduce a friend to this person, how would you hype them up, how would you introduce them?

The answers will give you a clue about how you want people to think about you as well.

Rebellious Underdog? Splinter? Mighty Ducks Coach?

People fit into archetypes.

Use 16personalities.com and take the test to see what comes out. It's Myers Briggs personified with examples of people who share your type.

And compare it to this list of ingrained archetypes that people respond to.

Tycoon (Trump/Gallant Dill/Sam Ovens)<br>
Puppeteer Behind the scenes (Munger/Mac/Carlton/Rosenberg/Roland Fraser)<br>
Intelligence Source (Bill Oreilly, Alex Jones)<br>
The Contrarian<br>
The Eccentric Researcher (Jordan Peterson)<br>
The Eclectic<br>
The Iconoclast (Doesn't' respect authority unless deserved. Willing to take risks. To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool -- they're rugged individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a fuck what tradition calls for. ... Stemming from the Greek words eikon, meaning "image," and klastes, meaning "breaker," an **iconoclast** was someone who destroyed religious sculptures and paintings. Destruction of icons. Challenges cherished beliefs<br>
The Angry Person<br>
The prodigy Genius (Ben Shapiro Who Is Also An ENTP Debater)<br>
The helpful librarian<br>
The Queen (Beyonce)<br>
The mom<br>
The diva<br>
The Futurist (Matt Trainer)<br>
The absent minded professor<br>
The punk rock chick<br>
The Family Man (Russell Brunson + Advocate)

I am an iconoclast mixed with the father. There is a dichotomy there, a struggle in those two. The aim to protect the industry and people in it while simultaneously destroying sacred cows and industry norms. It makes my personality dynamic and not boring. It's like the type of women and men who are addicted to the drama of a relationship that is good and bad at the same time. This was Tupacs personal battle and the Media's battle with him. Soap opera. This is obviously less dramatic than a soap opera. struggle between good and evil. The tugging tension is what draws people in. Its unresolved.

Father Freedom \= Father figure to my industry who wants freedom. JUDGE. Father \= God. You treat your market how you treat your kids. You love them, guide them, and lay the smackdown on them sometimes. As an industry in chaos they need father figures who will stand up for them, and to them.

**Them + Offers**

**I have all the training you need on my website. Use the Morris doc as a cheat sheet. But you gotta understand the REASONS someone will want what you got.**

**What's your path for them. What's their success path. Stu mclaren - tribes.**

**Who's their villain!?**

**What is your offering. Is it irresistible. Is it soft or hard? If soft, you need to make it hard or include a measurement component.**

**We'll break down my offers in the central bank section.**

Quick Hacks

- Do talks. Speak all you can (The attention hierarchy + crippling fear ppl get, gives you default status)

- Do events and get people higher status than you to speak at your event

- Get on the news or Cable TV

- Google local business events. Reach out directly. I'd love to speak at your conference for 15 min and I'll promote it to all my people.

- Create a talk with a killer headline and stories that are so irresistible and based in curiosity, people have to hear em - borderline clickbait. Like create a canned talk. It's your lead magnet

- It's all a stair step up. You use the prior cred to step up

- Tai Lopez's tip is to have a regular meeting at your home every month. Be Known for that. A Champagne party. Tai said this is how he really started and got going

- Hefner never went to other people's parties.

What's your attitude? How's your tone?

**BR/NR/TR**

Example of BR Tone: Eminem - Kamikaze Album Track #4

Do you talk like a police officer or a waiter

Authority.

**Authority \= High Status \= High Status Behaviors**

This is a popularity game - we are back in high school.

Resources and opportunities pile up and accrue to highest status and consistent attention is the first step to getting there:

Higher status you become, high status people want to align with you as well.

The foundation of Status is high status behavior. Your Forbes article is useless if you act like a low status person.

This is why everyone is trying so hard to be a high status authority in the marketplace, doing all these "things" to get cred, even saying all the right things... but wheels spin. Because it's usually about what you don't say. And if you are trying to be high status, you are automatically behaving low status. So everything you do is drenched in the color "loser" for all to see.

The Challenge With Taking Out Your Sword Is That You Must Be Willing To Die On It

EVERYONE IS DOING ALL OF THIS OUT OF Desperation. One toe in the pool

Failing to realize you are engaging in low status behavior is like not being able to see the forest for the trees - you can never diagnose your own problem because you are analyzing everything from inside of it.

So the question becomes: What is high status behavior and what is low status behavior?

**High status behavior**

- Drawing your mood and self worth from yourself (Inner vs outer)
- Knowing your values/standards, and sticking to them
- Knowing your boundaries and sticking to them
- Feel a high sense of entitlement to take what you want
- Protector of loved ones / market
- Humor
- Leader of men
- Risk Taker
- Social alignments
- World Traveler
- Walking through the world with ease
- Willingness to share and provoke emotion
- Trusting yourself to perform in the moment
- View sales and marketing as "no big deal"
- Optimist
- A mastery attitude vs must have now
- Self amuse - don't seek reactions
- Tone of voice (TR/NR/BR)
- You are the buyer in your social life not the seller
- Dictate the vibe and frame
- Use qualification and disqualification
- Be clear in your intent (Don't have split intentions!)
- A Storyteller and painter of emotions
- LEAD
- Assume - Assume - Assume (Self fulfilling prophecy)

**Low status behavior**

- The mirror image opposite of the high status behaviors
- Overly emotional and reactive
- Too much self deprecating behavior
- Not having any money (and telling people that)
- Trying to impress people
- Performing too many favors
- Being "the nice guy" who gets stepped on then then moping about it
- Not standing up for themselves
- Bragging about accomplishments in a needy way
- Being ignorant
- Caring about what others think so much as to alter your behavior even though you didn't really want to
- Poor social awareness (Can't catch context/humor/sarcasm/insulting)

**Momentum**

People need to feel you are in an upward spiral. Everyone is an ambulance chaser to an extent. And the opposite is true - people scatter like roaches if they smell a downward spiral.

The #1 thing people need to feel from you on social media over time is _"Proof of constant upwards momentum"._

That you are living what you say every day and things are getting better for you.

**Aliveness & Movement**

The question I always ask myself and others is "How alive does this profile feel"

Aliveness & Movement:

- Multiple media formats including video (video is best if not super polished)
- Quantity of posting
- Consistency of posting
- Location switching
- How much you let them in
- Drama and controversy

TRY to post daily - even if it's just anything at all. Familiarity \= liking and trust. Think kidnapper infatuation.

They need you to be their leader. Means **you need to show up for them** daily. To be the strength they may not always have. Their rock to lean on.

**Consistency \= Trust**

Not being consistent is like being a delinquent parent. They are looking to be led and find comfort in you showing up every day. It's time to be their fearless leader.

![][image6]

You don't need to act further along than you are, you just need to show that we will be doing this together. And "I'll lead the way". That's how you avoid the whole incongruence. "I haven't been there but I'll take us there" Think those Disney movies about treasure hunts. Nobody knows what is going to happen, but you lead the way, have faith and have the vision for the others.

**People follow people who**<br>
**are braver than them**

The willingness to be controversial and speak your mind shows that you are willing to fight and be brave.

People will feel more comfortable giving you the lead if they know you are willing to fight for them.

Most of you are forgettable because you are too afraid to stand out

Huge reason ppl will never go all in: not emotionally stable enough to handle the social pressure

You need to be comfortable with, as Carl Jung called it, your shadow. Your darkside. You need to be potentially dangerous. It's how people can trust you. They can't trust you if you are a pushover or approval seeker, especially to them.

**To Ponder**: Are you someone they want to be or have something they'd like to have? Or.. Are you hilarious enough of a character.

We are designed to carry a heavy burden. Go all in.

YOU NEED TO ALWAYS BE MAKING OFFERS

**Be true to yourself**<br>

**The New World Order _Action Plan_**

**You Need A Foundational 3 Part Content Split**

Posting to keep people engaged on a meta level is not rocket surgery, just timeless fundamentals taken from the **old school newsletter business.**

In order to keep people paying their subscriptions, they couldn't just give good "advice". People would drop off. They had to add other elements, specifically entertainment and off topic content.

**A sample social media schedule**

_Watch this ratio_ over a day, week, and month:

33% direct helpful advice and information (make as unique and entertaining as possible/not like everyone else. Be creative, tell good stories)

33% Semi relevant - Like a current event that ties into industry, commentary on culture etc... A contest, survey, jokes

33% Off topic entertainment/Your life and lifestyle. Let them in, be the reality show. Be entertaining and inspiring but be real. The motion video provides is important.

This can work out to daily:

_1 advice post_<br>
_1 link share or commentary, or though on current event, or one shout out, or testimonial, or question_

_1 lifestyle pic or video. Personal stuff that is also high status. Remember - trying to be high status is low status._

That's 3 posts per day at a minimum

**2x/week post proof/social proof** in the form of a testimonial, review, or case study. You can create a photo album called reviews and testimonials and upload 2x/week to it. No real need to make a big production/post out of it, we can do THAT once a week. If you don't have social1 proof yet, post success stories you find on the internet and provide commentary on them.

Once per week, **ask a GOOD, possibly controversial but relevant question** to get their opinions on a topic. This grows your audience since organic FB is mostly word of mouth.

**Once per week, we do a CTA** and push them somewhere to buy or check out something

Once per week **SHOWCASE one of your students or employees** and praise them.

Have a VA **send a "Happy Birthday John, I hope you have a great day!" everyday** to every birthday

**Groom Your Wall! h[ttps://youtu.be/NTT3wOgkO_kh](https://youtu.be/NTT3wOgkO_k)**

**Make everything an event**<br>
**or a lead up to one**

**The Buzz**

I learned this from my days playing rock music trying to get our band famous. There is an industry term called buzz. **Buzz is how many people are talking about you at the same time.** The general chatter around the industry.

This is why consistency is so important. If you are inconsistent, people talk about you inconsistently. That is bad for a every almost "woo woo" reason. Think of your own popularity as a wave. It needs enough force to gain momentum. If the power of buzz \= how many people are talking about you at the same time, because think about it, the more people talking about you at the same time, the more other people hear and, research, and talk, and the whole thing begins to swell like a wave. Eventually, if you are lucky, the wave takes on a life of it's own and you can't stop it even if you try - kinda like an out of control scandal.

This is why controversy launches careers into the stratosphere.

You always have things coming up or arriving.

This is how you keep the buzz about you.

Think of your social media life as a series of overlapping storylines that are always blooming and coming to fruition. Just like the multiple thread theory of conversational storytelling (see video).

They make you iconic. If people are always talking about you, that's what creates buzz and as stated before, buz is the number of people talking about you at the same time.

Keep them talking about you so the wave can build. And you don't relent. You don't let go. Because just like a sneeze or an orgasm, if it goes away, you gotta build from scratch. They need stories and rumors to spread about you. Give it to them.

This is why everything is an event... We are wired for anticipation

**Treasure Chest**<br>
**Gold Nuggets**

"Enjoy the little things in life because one day you'll come to realize they were actually the big things..."

Small things mixed together add up to big things.

Synergy is the secret, and also how people can't figure out how you do it. _The Pyramid Theory_ mixed with the _Central Bank Business Models_, mixed with _The New World Order Action Plan_, And these _Treasure Chest Gold Nuggets_ will make you unstoppable.

Some if what you do will work and succeed _in spite of these things_ and that's fine. Just be careful of hitting the jackpot once and now thinking gambling isn't risky anymore. Break these at your peril

**Long Vacation With A New Lover**

The honeymoon period of any relationship is not a true measure of the quality of that relationship. Time is the only true way to trust someone. Consistency over time is the only true credibility. A 2 day romantic trip to the mountains can be a beautiful getaway, but to really test how well you know eachother, book a 365 day trip around the world. See how much you like them then. Crazy people get married a month after meeting each other, normal people wait a bit.

**The Glass Soul**

Repeat after me: The self is always coming through. What does this mean? It means there is nothing you can do to hide who you really are. Only seriously deranged people - sociopaths, serial killers, etc. can hide who you are. _This is incredibly liberating._ It means you don't have to try to be better, cool, or more on point than you are because the self is always coming through. Because it's always coming through, you can drop the mask and the performance. You can RELAX. Knowing you are bettering yourself and you'll just keep developing into who you are really meant to be. This paradoxically makes you more cool almost instantly without any more work put into it.

**The Dirt Devil VS The Electric Fan On A Hot Summer's Day**

They want you to be cool. They need you to be cool. It's a hot summer's day for them You are hell bent on trying to show them you don't suck, while they really just need a fan to make em feel good.

Trying to prove you don't suck is the opposite energy you want to give out - you are looking to them for validation you don't suck - this means you are trying to take from them like a black hole of neediness. Instead, just be a fan and blow your awesomeness all over them. We call this, Impression vs expression.

_Instead of doing things to impress people, just express who you are._ One is giving in order to get, the other is just being yourself. Which one will be more attractive? Which one can they trust? Which one feels better? Which one is less suspicious? Which one is less manipulative?

**Small Town Boy**

Small town boy always talking about the small town drama. Always mentioning quirks about the specific media you are on \= small world thinking and keeps your position small. "Hey guys, you notice the algorithm acting up lately?" "Facebook this, Facebook that". The more you show you think about the small stuff, the less you are trusted for the big stuff. Rich people rarely keep track of the price of bread, or gasoline, and they definitely don't debate over the cost of bread in different stores. Also refrain from low value behaviors (common behaviors) like asking people what their biggest problem with X is, or the typical colored background with inspirational or even helpful sentence. Low value behaviors are simply the most common behaviors - the mediocre majority all does the same things. The Cover photo that invites to a FB group. Talking about YouTube being down.<br>

**The Birthday Greeting**

Always message a happy birthday greeting to people in your audience if you can. If possible, via private message. There are hidden benefits to doing this: You will elicit testimonials from people who didn't bother reaching out before. As you build your position, you will genuinely make people's day by messaging them. Builds rapid rapport especially if you already have it. If they see you've messaged them happy birthday over consecutive years, you get trust and cred. Use your assistant for this so it's automated and out of your mind.

**Your Executive Assistant**

Hire an assistant to help you in your personal and social life. There are many daily tasks you should not be doing because you can not have the time. An assistant might just be the most valuable and important person on your entire team. I basically forbid you to not do the following things very often at all:

- Responding to messages from strangers
- Booking calls and appointments
- Sending documents and links to people
- Compiling information from comments
- Greeting happy birthday
- Signing up to and canceling services
- Management of your calendar
- Booking flights, hotels, and restaurants
- Inquiring
- Collecting your posts and content into a folder
- Managing your email inbox
- Managing logins and passwords
- Collecting payments
- Letting people down / Gatekeeping
- Reminding you of things a million times

**The Eminem Principle**

In 1995 Eminem released an album called Infinite. It was supposed to be his breakthrough demo tape. Instead, it got mostly crickets. It was the same stuff everyone else was rapping about. He had skills but the content was predictable. Don't be too predictable because you become _boring_, then nobody pays attention, they tune out. You SHOULD become predictable in your mannerisms and image as we'll talk about later, but you do not want to be predictable. Eminem only saw real success when he adopted the Slim Shady alter ego, and went wild...

**The Slim Shady Principle**

Creating your own boundaries to play in.

Like a coloring book, if you create your own image too restricted, you'll be forced to color within your own boundaries you made and you are limited in the range of behavior you can get away with without ruining your reputation and career.

Create a large range of behavior people expect you to operate in. Example - A priest has a small range of acceptable behavior vs eminem. You can get away with whatever expectations you set from the start or you'll be crucified when you fuck up (and you will fuck up). Build in wiggle room into your persona. You create your own boundaries.

**Simon Cowell's Status Strategy**

Learned this from Dan Kennedy. Turn ordinary acts into extraordinary acts by virtue of being known to not do them. - Trump not doing handshakes / me not answering messages / Simon Cowell not liking anything. This makes normal behavior have super powers.

**The Reverend Recipe**

Instead of shouting your values to make people understand them, preach to the choir to strengthen the bond with the members of your church. Be a reverend, not a salesman. A reverend talks in assumptive language and tones. You accept it because he assumes you already accept it by virtue of being there. You don't need to convince them, you speak the gospel to those who already share your world view. If you go around trying to convince people, you are talking to the wrong people. This is insanely profound.

**Content Cherishing**

Don't treat a piece of content more important than it is. Don't _not_ post for a day cuz you want it to be seen more. Keep posting, the good posts will stay alive. Facebook does not split up reach, this is scarcity thinking. Quantity and consistency trumps inconsistent quality.

**Keep Moving The Free Line**

If people aren't telling you "I can't believe this is free" or "You should be charging for this" on a regular basis, your content is good enough. If they DO say stuff like that, then that means you are on the right track. Keep giving that caliber away for free and raise it.

**The Trojan Sandwich**

If you are gonna make an offer post...

1. Post a testimonial/proof of results/some sort of cred _before_
2. Post a killer content piece or controversial question _after_

The idea is to feed your usually low engagement sales post with the people who came by for the high engagement one. People WILL check your wall for more stuff, and since they engaged with the bread in your sandwich, Facebook is more likely to show em the meat.

**The Principle Of Least Interest**

He (or she/it/zee/them/zur) who is the least interested in the interaction, has the power and control of that interaction. This goes for _comment sections_ as much as it does _tone of voice._ And being seen online too much. Too many of you like and comment on everything and are the first to do so. Cut it out. This also means not posting for validation, and posting the truth even if only one person likes it.

**Being The Meta Beast**

Don't pigeonhole your position to just "one thing" be known for meta things but the idea is you are choosing this one thing right now. If you are an instagram expert, you really want people to know you are a marketing expert in GENERAL if you want your instagram expert positioning to be powerful. This will put you above other instagram experts because _you have a foundation you make sure they know about._ Many also have it, but you are the one to promote it as part of your identity. This will also allow you to move around without identity crisis or push back. It gives you more credibility and people take you more seriously.

**Hidden Insecurities**

Stop saying what you are gonna say _right before you say it_. Or telling people how to receive what you are telling them. _"here comes a truth bomb"_ _"here's' some real talk"_ _"this is gonna offend some people" "get ready for a mic drop"_ Those decisions are not up to you. And you look like an approval seeking bitch when doing this. It shines a light on massive insecurity about what you are about to say. That alone can kill any content that comes after it, though not all the time (which can give you a false sense that it's okay to do). Your audience will decide if it's a truth bomb, and by telling them it is, you make them not want to comment it is, even if it was.

**Climbing Down Off Cloud Nine**

Everyone is fighting human nature and what works in an attempt to be unique. It IS good to be unique in your delivery, but NOT okay to be unique in your frameworks. They think they can do it their way... LOOK at successful marketing and study the principles. Follow the principles and ORDER based on what IS already working NOW. You can add your flavor, but the more you deviate from the proven, the smaller your audience will be and the less money you will make. The perfect example is Nickelback, Foo Fighters, and the mainstream song format vs experimental heavy metal. The more you move away from intro - verse - chorus - verse - chorus - bridge - chorus, the higher the risk and the smaller the audience. Same in marketing.

**Emotional About Emojis**

You want to be very deliberate (ie: not doing shit just because others are) about how you want to be perceived and what your personality/persona is. I choose to _not capitalize every word when I start a post_, or _over emoji the body of my content_. Based on who I am and want to be perceived.<br>
In both of those examples, I feel if I do them, I am crying for attention vs trusting my relationship with my audience is such that they will get into it just because I posted it. These are subtle energy and vibe distinctions that matter and conversations you want to have with yourself and your team

**Make Them Want It Before You Offer It**

You gotta do all of this positioning stuff and give so much value in advance that you create demand for people to give you money before asking for it. And it comes in waves. You can feel it. But if you aren't willing to create a consistent wave, you don't deserve to stand up on the surfboard and ask for claps or money. But make sure they know you make money off this SOMEHOW. You don't want to get trapped in that everyone thinks you are only a free resource - they'll get angry if you try to sell them. The rock band System Of A Down's first show ever was sold out, because they marketed underground and built a fanbase and buzz in advance. Contrast that with every other band that plays to nobody all the time.

**Don't Be A Lottery Winner**

Settle down. Don't make everything a big deal on your come up in a "this doesn't happen to me much, or I'm surprised myself" way. If you get a client, don't celebrate like you won the lottery, and the same with traveling somewhere. The vibe is more like "Of course this is happening". This is who I am. Because if you are overly excited at stuff, it projects to yourself and the world that this is a rare occurrence, and you'll attract less of it. It also makes your position weak.

![][image11]![][image12]

**The Big Lie**

This is an odd observation. The more extreme the results you have, the less you need to prove it. The easier they believe it. Maybe because they are clouded by greed? And above a certain level of success, it's just automatically accepted? I looked into this recently and turns out this idea was coined "the big lie" by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf. It is a propaganda technique. _A lie so "colossal" that no one would believe that someone "could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously"._ I would never say to lie, that's not my point here, my point is that **the more impressive or extreme the result you are sharing with your audience, the less you have to sell it.** And the more you do, you risk overselling, that is talking them right out of believing something they already believed. Like a billionaire convincing you he is rich - that's weird.

*****Content Scarcity**

Got the idea from my friend Wade Alters. The idea that someone believes content is so valuable, scarce, and limited that you unintentionally hoard and hold back. This is the exact opposite of what you need to do and kills people's organic results.

**Will The Real Slim Shady Please Stand Up**

What to do when someone rips off ur content? NOTHING. Don't even bring it up. No, it's not an opportunity to bond to your audience or another clever thing to post about. It's a low value behavior and reaction. Would Tony Robbins? You shouldn't either. It's always the broke nobodies who bring it up and make a production of it. This goes for your products being sold on pirate websites. You can be a whiny bitch like Lars Ulrich or you can be grateful your stuff is worth being ripped off. Every moment you spend fighting over 1 dollar, you could have made 5\. That is a stupid trade just for some "justice". Get over yourself.

**Engagement (Master)Baiters**

Don't post _just_ for engagement and if you do, especially don't fucking tell people that. It's easy to see who does that because they are always asking dumb ass questions and can't come up with content to save their lives (nothing personal in this particular example, but it is a perfect illustration of the point.

![][image13]

**Speed Round**

✔️Your certainty must be greater than their uncertainty

✔️You are to be an inspiring example of hope and what is possible

✔️Show less than you tell

✔️Don't take yourself too seriously

✔️Style trumps substance

✔️Entertainment trumps truth

✔️High status is not holding back, and owning your truth

✔️Make your posts public god damn it, I don't care the excuse

✔️The stronger you defend your values that they also share, the stronger they'll defend _you_ when someone challenges you

✔️Allow them to surf on your dopamine waves. Create and evoke feelings and emotions. We are just dealers of emotions.

**The Ultimate Formula For An Attractive Vibe**

Most people actually repel people away from them. Salesmen can't make sales, and marketers spin their wheels trying to get clients. This is a major, of not the major reason this happens. There is a scale that needs to be balanced.

Intent & Freedom from outcome

You must have one clear intent for what you want and are doing + complete Freedom from the outcome of the intention you have.

This is the secret sauce to sales and the secret to dating.

Example of a clear intent: I intend to close this sale today.

Example of a cloudy(split) intent: I intend to close this sale today but I also don't want them to think I'm being pushy

The split intent will kill you. Now, you must also balance your clear intent with freedom from outcome of the result. In other words, you very much WANT the outcome but paradoxically you are not emotionally affected by the POSSIBILITY of not getting the outcome (because you live in abundance, not scarcity).

**How To Not Be A Livestream Twat**

When you go live, don't "wait a few minutes for others to come on", just start. And don't do the typical _"hey guys. So today, I wanted to talk about the topic of X. This is how I got the idea for it."_ JUST FUCKING START. The reason is because the bulk of your viewers will be watching the replay so why the fuck are you making them wade through a swamp of your rambling bullshit? Respect their time more and stop assuming they have any patience for even a second of umming and awing - because they don't. You aren't Tony Robbins yet. People fuck around at the beginning by the way because they just want to see that number rise for their dopamine and confidence vs helping people.

**Giving Your Power Away**

![][image14]<br>
![][image15]

**Back From The Grave**

Once per day, pick an old yet popular status of yours and answer a comment, or make a comment. This will resurrect it in the feed for your entire audience. Works like a charm to keep you relevant.

**Everything In Excess Becomes Its Opposite**

The more you do something, the less it holds its power. The harder you try to be something, the less people want to accept you being it.

**The Orange Peel Principle**

A Simple Orange... Becomes:

Orange peel, pulp, and seed makes healthy livestock feed

Oil from the peel \= essential oil, and perfume

Chilled juice or frozen concentrate. In jugs, cartons, boxes.

Popsicles, candy, pastries, marmalade, tea

House cleaner, face mask, and somehow even a fire starter

There are futures and options on future contracts for Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice traded on the market.

You could sell information about investing in orange juice futures.

You could even do a piece of content about everything I just said and will say on this topic just like I'm doing now. The thing to understand about derivatives is it's almost limitless the mileage you can get out of a single item.

Did you have a piece of content? Then maximise that shit over time by creating derivatives, derivatives of derivatives, and derivatives of derivatives of derivatives.

1. Speak it into a mic and turn it into an audio clip - then elaborate. Now you got a podcast
2. Break off the one killer quote and post just that at a later date
3. Turn it into an infographic
4. Turn it into an ad
5. Speak it into a video and put it on Youtube
6. Put it on your blog
7. Guest blog post
8. Pull out a paragraph and add it to the calendar you are making
9. Make it a chapter of your new book
10. The book becomes a curriculum and a coaching program, live retreat, and TED talk

**Emojis Are Off Limits**

The odds of you being able to pull of cocky wink face emojis in your content and comments is lower than you think. Mostly comes off as insecure... or butthurt. Use with caution, most ppl don't. If you don't yet objectively have high status in your market, you don't get to use the wink face. And it is low status behavior to use wink faces, lols, haha, and kiss faces if you are arguing about something and a grown man

**Money For Nothing And The Chicks For Free**

Everyone is trying so hard to manufacture credibility through PR articles, podcast interviews, and all of these "credibility indicators", instead of putting in the work to being good at what you do first. It should be a prerequisite. Earn your cred for god sakes. Too many people want to be recognised now for their future talent. Fuck your ego in the ass and strap up with skills before you come to battle. Otherwise you just look delusional.

**The 4th Wall**

Breaking the 4th wall builds trust and loyalty. Google breaking the 4th wall because it's hard to explain. even as I'm writing this principle out right here, I feel nervous about it because I'm not sure exactly how to describe it. It's 11:40 pm and I have a flight to Thailand tomorrow. There's a glass of water beside me I'm too lazy to grab. Anyway, breaking the 4th wall is kind of like what I just did. It's when an actor breaks character or context, and addresses the audience.

People are dying to look past the 4th wall. I remember desperately wanting to see behind the curtains of WWE superstars. I was insanely curious about what Oscar the grouch's home looked like... What part of your life do you NOT let people into?

**Nice Guys Finish Last**

People need to know you _can be_ dangerous and are not a pushover. Enough said.

**Alignment & Shit**

What you're saying and what you are doing, need to be the same. People can feel the incongruity and that is likely a hidden reason you can be saying all the right things, yet not sell or influence.

**American Pie Pussy**

_Political Correctness: The avoidance, often considered as taken to extremes, of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against._

Political correctness is a disease. Be yourself. Don't try to be the person everyone likes. It doesn't work. Note how the one who always tries to do that is the beta male in the movies. So, you can be _Starbucks_ or the _craft coffee shop_ you actually want to wear a shirt of. There is a reason hidden door speakeasy bars are rising in popularity and why people go there. You also don't need to adopt anyone's personality to be successful. You just need to refine how to be a likable person in general. Reading "How To Win Friends And Influence People" a couple times a year oughta do it.<br>
![][image16]

**The content to proof ratio**

the amount of talk/content/theory must be balanced with proof and action. The more you lean on talking, the more "fake life coachy" you get. The ratio is what allows u to get away with more content. Best to combine the two together, like a seminar clip, or interview with a student or something. It's a full of shit scale of content vs proof you are embodying what you are sharing. You can't just hammer out content. Infield vs theory. You gotta balance your gum flapping with proof. Lean too far into gum flapping territory, the more you look like broke coach in the bedroom fishing for money.

**Charisma on demand**

the less needy you are for approval from everyone, the more polarising(magnetic/charismatic) you are by default because you can't be controlled and you aren't trying to micromanage perceptions of you. Add in a dash of smart ass and humor/wit, you are a charismatic animal

**the most expensive payday loan in the world**

Past in payday loan post here

**When authenticity blows up in your face**

never talk about your financial position if it isn't good, for the same reason you don't talk about the steamy shits you take: its a turn off and nobody wants to hear bout it. If you sell money making, it's a deathwish. It would be like telling her you have Herpes right after you introduce yourself. Good luck digging out of that grave

**The brag to self deprivation ratio**

There is a "brag to self deprecation" scale. The more humble and self aware you display, the more brag and cocky you can get away with.

**Tantalising Tantra secrets to great content**

Don't release the tension Make your content engaging by teasing it out, just like most good jokes build up the punchline by keeping suspense.<br>
![][image17]

**Love Your Haters - Without Them You'll Never Be Successful**

Having active haters gives you energy and makes you produce your best work. It forces you to push back and fight better, sharper, and harder. We are born to battle. And as a little secret: They never actually hate you - just your position and how you are a constant reminder of where they are dropping the ball in their life. The secret here is to not actually hate your haters inside, this will allow you to move against them with power and focus, don't be like a fighter who Connor got under his skin. It also allows you to retain your humor which will have you win more. The one who takes it less seriously, wins.

**You better not be the hero of their story**

Because they are...

**Watch your positivity to negativity ratio**

Go through your profile and ask yourself every week, "over all, does my profile feel too negative or too positive. What is the overall vibe here. 50/50? 70/30?" Do your best to keep it pretty balanced, preferably a 70/30

**Generalist seek clients**.

**Clients seek specialist.**Btw - I position myself as a generalist that is currently specializing. This allows me to have umbrella status on marketing in general, gives me more cred because I am known for knowing the general topic so well, then I can zoom in and out at various points in my career without needing to redefine or get pushback

**Pick a side**

When it comes to interviews and press, you either do everything all the time like Gary v, or you do extremely little and on your own terms so they are valued events. Like Eminem or Dan Kennedy. Or go in waves that are pre negotiated and come to be expected (example is "interview season". Turning everything into an event again lol)

**Pull the future forward**

The trick with prospects is to treat them like they already paid you. Like that 'weird' part is already over and you are friends. This is extremely powerful from an energetic level

**It's ok your social media has ebbs and flows**

The well pumping principle. Your results of ur social efforts will be delayed. Never judge based on immediate response.Everyone is doing fits and starts so water never comes out.

**Bread crumbs can sometimes be more powerful than the whole sandwich**

You elude _most of the time_ to what you are selling without outright selling it. That tilts the vibe to non-needy or like you are a beggar.

**Your timeline and the newsfeed are two different places**

**Risk to reward promise ratio for your offers**

Price matters too much. #1 reason ppl don't buy. Fear of disappointment. Anticipate negative story..

**Mark Twain's school of getting to the point**

"If you want me to give you a two-hour presentation, I am ready today. If you want only a five-minute speech, it will take me two weeks to prepare."

**people crave conflict**

All good stories have conflict that needs resolution. That is where they put their attention to. Period. Soap operas. Workplace. Contrast between Eminem's revival and kamikaze releases. You can either give people what they want or not. Someone else will I assure you. Avoiding conflict is avoiding storytelling and this game is storytelling.

**My most liked post ever is also my most hated post ever**

This isn't an accident, this is how it works in social media, or politics. If you want big likes, comments, status, recognition, then you must decide to equally want the negative. If you don't, you'll always hold back and your growth will be dampened. Brakes will be on. You must want the bad as much as you want the good.

Creating controversy and a flame battle is good for your position and following.

Controversy is important because...

You are an ongoing story. And no story is interesting without a conflict. That's what a narrative is. Conflict resolution. Too many people are trying to create an ongoing reality show with no conflict. Who would ever watch that? Be careful to not make it like a gimmick you overuse.

Here's how you create a shit storm:

I've discovered an organic posting spectrum.

"Carefully vs carelessly"

It's like a spectrum of context, where the far left is a irrefutable context you've laid out that has the least amount of confusion or context twisting.

The more you move to the right, the less precise your message will be from your intended context, but the more the discussion opens up because people make up their own contexts vs having carefully laid out a bulletproof one for them.

You can crank it up and cause a shit storm. A few of your followers will hate it and spread it to others and it will go viral and pull people in to fight. It's like a war. Your followers go to battle with the intruders. This is important for fostering extreme trust and bonding with your audience. It's all about investment and trust.

Also - you drive your enemies nuts the more fun you have

**Being A Friend**

Building a personal brand is like making a friend in real life, yet most people just bore their audience to death with content. The difference is you want to be larger than life. That's what celebrities are.

Step one is true consistency. The better the "friend", the more you talk to them right? Make sure you show up daily. And just like a good friend, you never only talk about one thing all day long. This is why entertainment is key... It keeps you from being predictable and boring.

Building a successful personal brand means more than sharing industry advice. It means constantly mixing Storytelling, Feelings, Humor, Community, Surprise, Mystery, Drama, controversy, and Fun.

In the same way a soap opera or a friendship takes you on a journey, so it should be with your brand too.

**Adopt a true sense of responsibility**

This is a big deal. Every status, video, or picture, think as if it's the first time someone is seeing you. Earn every update. Imagine all your friends and followers are talking to each other at a party. Does what you are interrupting them with, deserve to interrupt them? Keeping in mid that every now and then, having the audacity to interrupt with BS builds authority.

**IMAGE**

The playing of food can make the difference between a good tasting dish, and a memory you'll never forget.

Consider, philosophically, the difference between these two pictures and the<br>
thought experiment of them _having never worn_ masks and jumpsuits and<br>
how it would have altered the course of their career.

![][image18]

You want to be deliberate and consistent about your costume and persona. MEMORABLE is the secret here. **Study Hulk Hogan**. Everyone looked forward to the SAME things. The consistency made him legendary. The ripping of the shirt. The same entrance music. The yellow and red colors. The cupping of the ear. The leg drop. The same moves. The Hulkamaniacs. The same mic promos. People did not get sick of it, but as he grew more popular, people couldn't get enough of it.

Your costume determines your behavior boundaries so you can use that to your advantage by breaking those assumptions and creating controversy based on the contrast. (So do meta roles, such as an "influencer" or "priest")

You can also dress based on who your market wishes they were but this is a high risk behavior if you can't be congruent to it. You can totally play a character tho. And don't listen to people who say that thinking of this stuff at all is inauthentic - it's not.

![][image19]

- Your color scheme
- Your character vibe
- Your accessories
- What you do or do not carry around
- Your curriculum
- Your catch phrases and vocabulary
- The music

**The Central Bank:**<br>
**Offers That Work**

**Hard Offers vs Soft Offers**

- **Confidence coaching vs pair of shoes**
- **Leadership training vs "one new client per day" training**
- **Marketing course vs "How to add 34% to your profits in 44 days with our marketing system" course**

**Soft offers are generally more difficult to sell than their hard offer counterparts so here are some ways to boost conversions for soft offers**

- **Make a hard offer where the bonus is the soft offer (trojan horse offer)**
- **Add a measurement tool to the soft offer**
- **Have a metric fuck ton of testimonials**
- **Be wary deviating... (procrastination coach/goal setting coach)**

**Offers To Revolve**

- Group Coaching
- One To One Coaching
- Paid Webinar Model
- A Book (Compilation of your content every 9 months)
- Information courses (Low Ticket)
- Information courses (High ticket, incl. token)
- Live events & Workshops
- Continuity community
- One off services
- Continuity services

The trick with this is to craft the offers so they are irresistible. Then you got em in your pocket to pull out when you want. Without the offers, you'll always struggle to get people to buy from you.

Now Accepting Applications For: The Dark Horse Society

Definition of dark horse: A competitor about whom little is known but who unexpectedly wins or succeeds.

This is a 12 month coaching and mentorship society 4 years in the making!

People have been asking about personal coaching for 4 years, and now is the time.

We opened this up for a very specific kind of person.

I'm looking for 10 people on the verge of success who need assistance breaking through and want my personal help.

Who are you?

You offer a service of some sort.

You are getting clients here and there.

You are getting more known.

But it's a grind.

And you want speed and money, now.

You are good at what you do but not good at getting paid consistently for it or selling yourself the right way.

You want to get more people reaching out to you and you'd like to close more packages at higher prices.

You provide a service but kinda floundering with self promotion and explaining what you do in an irresistible way so people are lining up to work with you.

You need that extra something to really breakthrough. Guidance, support, accountability, advice, strategies.

You know you got serious potential but need help with:

🐴 Charging and getting high prices

🐴 Attracting clients

🐴 Positioning and authority building

🐴 Getting known and popular

🐴 Consistent leads

🐴 Consistent sales

🐴 Selling on the phone

🐴 Closing sales

🐴 Writing copy

🐴 Posting content

🐴 Your messaging and brand

🐴 Access to me

🐴 Accountability

You need a secret weapon on your side.

If you are so close to breaking through you can almost taste it...

Then this is your shot.

A shot at finally cracking this nut and becoming successful with your online business.

This is 4 years in the making...

A total coaching and mentorship experience...

10 people will have their lives changed by this time next year.

✔️ Copy concierge service (one piece of sales copy per month critiqued by me)

✔️ Private accountability/Whatsapp society chat group

✔️ 4 in-person dark horse masterminds per year at my house (each is 5 days long)

That's 20 days out of every year, you get to hang out at my home and get my personal help.

If you are ready to get your shit handled once and for all, this is how it's done. Come get direct help from someone who is actively doing it.

Enough with trying to copy everyone around you.

Enough taking advice from people who are barely ahead of you and probably faking it anyway.

Enough of writing shit copy that makes nobody want to work with you

Enough of moving so slow that even a turtle is offended.

It's time to get my help.

Were not going to go easy on you.

You are either in it to win it at all costs or you are not.

I'll hold your hand but you may sometimes need a slap at the same time.

Some of you have families, it's time to provide for their future and cement your legacy.

No more games.

This doesn't need to be a lonely road.

You can do anything you set your mind to, but sometimes we need help.

This is a 12 month commitment from me, and from you.

This world is yours for the taking

If you had one shot, one opportunity

To seize everything you ever wanted

One moment

Would you capture it or just let it slip?

You have two choices today...

1\. Continue on as you are and probably be in the same place next year

2\. Bet on yourself today and show up next year with a consistent multi-six figure net income

The people I help personally, succeed. Period.

PM for a call to see if we are a fit

**POST #1**

If you are at all interested in upping your marketing game, getting more clients, and being taken more seriously, this post is for you!

Have you ever heard of the concept of misweighting?

It's an error in thinking where we do the right thing in the wrong order, that is, we dont do the most important thing first.

Sequencing is everything right? You wouldn't put the headline halfway down the sales letter!

To build authority, sell your products, and get clients... people focus on things like selling, their website, their product images, or their branding - but it's mis-weighted because it's out of order to what's most important to you right now.

A great example of this is how we think about our health.

Most of us are optimizing from the least effective up, starting with supplements, and weight training, and then food. The reality is there are more important things to optimize first.

How long can you go without oxygen?

Water?

Sleep?

Food?

Weightlifting?

1\. Oxygen (5 minutes)

2\. Water (3 days)

2\. Sleep (11 days)

3\. Food (3 weeks)

4\. Weightlifting (years and years)

5\. Supplements (forever)

So realistically if weighted properly, for health it's probably best to master daily habits in this order:

Cardio every morning with deep breathing.

A lot of water every single day.

Sleep a minimum of 8 hours.

Eat real, natural foods.

Lift weights 3x4 times per week.

Take supplements

So, how does this apply to you in marketing yourself and your business?

Understand the same applies here and the one important foundational pillar you first need is having excellent content.

Yet paradoxically (but not surprising), it's the one thing most of us blow at.

If your content is boring, average, and lame, how do you expect your customers to think your paid products will be any better?

It's like advertising a dirty showhome with no furniture inside - who would want to buy after seeing that? If you are reading this, you know your content needs help. This is non negotiable!

And it isn't that hard...

You can either keep struggling with it, or you can leverage my 12 years of experience and unconscious competence to train you to do it the right way.

It's no surprise to you I'm a monster at creating content and I can come up with original shit all day long - I dare anyone to try and pass me. In fact, when I teach you to write like i do, I hope you DO eclipse me! That means I did my job correctly.

Want a shortcut?

For the first time ever, I'll conduct an online writing clinic for anyone serious about getting their content and posting skills in check.

I'll show you behind the scenes of how I think of a topic, flesh out the thoughts, and arrange it all together. I'll even think of one and write it on the spot, telling you what I am thinking as I'm doing it, including all the edits and corrections.

I'll demonstrate and teach you:

- How to have endless ideas

- How to spin them so the angle is unique to you

- The main strategy to my content I learned from Hollywood movies

- The 3 things I ALWAYS make sure I put in my posts

- How my content is actually like seeing a therapist and discover how I systematically blow people's minds

- How to create aha moments

- How to finish or wrap up at the end for maximum impact

- How to ride the line between aggressive but not mean

After 4 hours, you'll know exactly what you need to do to be seen and respected as a thought leader. Writing better content will get you clients, opportunities, and respect.

You'll be able to write posts, articles, rants, and blog posts in a whole new way after this.

I can't tell you how critically important it is to be able to word your content in a way where people go crazy for it. If you've been trying so hard and doing everything right, but nobody is paying attention, what do you think is left to get in order? This is your missing piece and this is what you need to focus on now.

It starts in 4 days, it's a 4 hour long clinic, and only $197\. You will get the recordings for yourself but this will not be available for purchase after - you must attend or purchase a slot to receive the recordings.

If you take the workshop and don't feel you learned anything new, and now have a new understanding and executable strategy of how to make irresistible content that makes you look like a rockstar, I'll return your money and snort wasabi on camera.

To register your spot to the clinic, PM me with the words "Noe, please save me a spot and send me a payment link".

Remember, this is not a public event and will not be for purchase after this Tuesday. I'll hold the clinic on Tuesday at 9pm EST time. I won't let you down and this will be special. Let's do this!

If you pay for an advertisement and it doesn't work, it means the advertisement didn't work right?

And so you change it. Until it does.

The same thing applies to social media. If you keep doing the same things and nothing is really happening, you are doing it wrong. It doesn't work. You can't out run a bad strategy.

I'll be 100% honest here: If you are trying to build your brand using organic social media and you are struggling (if you are honest with yourself), it means your content is boring.

Boring pictures, boring writing, boring advice, boring image (contact [Marshall Wayne](https://www.facebook.com/stopmar?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARAv9qfNN91y8MeVmq1ZaOrZyqMwTVtifP6MLvHjq9HJxGRNCNjYmHtAjOEoYnRM15zwjt3h5eg-UrIc&fref=mentions) to fix that), boring videos, and boring life.

If you really stepped back and looked at your social media from an outside perspective, would you pay attention to yourself?

I'd barely pay attention to myself.

Isn't it time you start doing the right things?

It's time to get your content in order, and we'll do it together in 3 days.

For the first time ever, I'll conduct an online writing clinic for anyone serious about getting their content and posting skills in check.

I'll show you behind the scenes of how I think of a topic, flesh out the thoughts, and arrange it all together. I'll even think of one and write it on the spot, telling you what I am thinking as I'm doing it, including all the edits and corrections.

I'll demonstrate and teach you:

- How to have endless ideas

- How to spin them so the angle is unique to you

- The main strategy to my content I learned from Hollywood movies

- The 3 things I ALWAYS make sure I put in my posts

- How my content is actually like seeing a therapist and discover how I systematically blow people's minds

- How to create aha moments

- How to finish or wrap up at the end for maximum impact

If you are marketing yourself or your business using Facebook, you can't just pitch all the time - you need content.

Not just any kind of content - damn good content. Because if you don't, a few things are gonna happen:

1\. You don't connect with your audience and they only see you as a thinly disguised walking sales pitch.

2\. Your content is so boring and "me too" you are ignored and nothing happens for you

This is your second last day to sign up for my one time only Content Clinic, where I'll show you how to write posts, articles, and content that makes your audience love you and want more from you.

It's an art and a science - I show you both.

You'll get peek into my process in which I think about and flesh out a topic. I'll show you exactly how to formulate words like I do, and you'll have a structure you can follow to do it yourself.

I'll even write one on the spot and edit it.

This is a 4 hour writing clinic - no experience required.

Want to up your content game? Who better to teach you. It's $197, happens on Tuesday the 23rd at 9pm EST. Recordings will be made available to everyone who purchases but they will NOT be for sale after.

Link to sign up is in the comments.

P.S. We have 30 people registered, yet only 20 have paid. I believe there is a correlation between speed of payment for things like this and success, but I'm not 100% sure yet. It's definitely true when it comes to clients and service work. If you haven't paid yet, now is a good time please. I close up the payment gateway tomorrow evening.

Tuesday will be a game changer. See you there.

P.S. money back guarantee - I put my money where my mouth is

Final chance: We're starting in just over 13 hours, you coming?

I'll be showing you how to create content for social media that makes you stand out from the crowd and impact your audience like nobody else can.

This is the biggest hurdle to social media - coming up with unique things to say and have everyone like it.

I've been told my free content has made many people tens of thousands of dollars. I'm told almost daily (no joke) my content is changing lives. Hell, I've been told my content has stopped people from committing suicide!

You may not realize the great responsibility you have to your audience. The responsibility to actually HELP them, instead of just selling stuff to them.

If you have a business, you must get your content in order. Most of what I see is BORING and the same as everyone else. Not only do you not make sales... you are doing anything for your industry. No impact, no sales, no help, nothing.

There is no excuse for not sharing good content on social media.

If you are reading this, you know your content needs help. Step up and fix it.

And it isn't that hard... You just need a guide.

You can either keep struggling with it, or you can leverage my 12 years experience and unconscious competence to train you to do it the right way.

It's no surprise to you I'm a monster at creating content and I can come up with original shit all day long - I dare anyone to try and pass me. In fact, when I reach you to write like i do, I hope you DO eclipse me! That means I did my job correctly.

Want a shortcut?

For the first time ever, I'll conduct an online writing clinic for anyone serious about getting their content and positing skills in check.

I'll show you behind the scenes of how I think of a topic, flesh out the thoughts, and arrange it all together. I'll even think of and write one on the spot, telling you what I am thinking as I'm doing it, including all the edits and corrections.

After 4 hours, you'll know exactly what you need to do to be seen and respected as a thought leader. Writing better content will get you clients, opportunities, and respect.

If you've been trying so hard and doing everything right, but nobody is paying attention, what do you think is left to get in order? This is your missing piece and this is what you need to focus on now.

It starts tonight at 9 pm EST, it's a 4 hour long clinic, and only $197\. You will get the recordings for yourself but this will not be available for purchase after - you must attend or purchase a slot to receive the recordings.

If you take the workshop and don't feel you learned anything new, and now have a new understanding and executable strategy of how to make irresistible content that makes you look like a rockstar, I'll return your money and snort wasabi on camera.

To register your spot to the clinic, pay using the link in the comments.

Remember, this is not a public event and will not be for purchase after this Tuesday.

P.S. We already hit 40 people, will you be one of the last 10? You won't find this information anywhere else, just straight from the horses mouth. Also - 10% of revenue will be directly sent to support families who need it in Manchester. We will have to wait a few days for the relief aid organizations to setup, and when we do, we will donate.

If you are ready to stand out from the crowd, I'll see you there.

**Paid Webinar #2**

**POST #1**

Wanna see the marketing campaign we created that made over $1,654,000 in immediate gross profit and OVER 10 MILLION PER MONTH in lifetime value in less than 60 days, spending only $30,200 to do it?

It was pretty crazy, and I'd like to show everything to you, including:

- The sales letter

- The webpages

- The emails

- The ads (and who ran them)

- Exactly how it performed

- The flow and the "big picture" of it all

- What really made it work

- What I would change if I had to do it again TODAY

Not only do I want to show the materials to you, I'm also going to just give them to you.

Imagine if you used it and only did 10% of what this did, it would still be great.

Along with Macaully, I'll analyze the entire campaign, show you exactly why it was a success, and go through the sales letter line by line with you.

In a period of a couple hours, youll have a powerful new framework YOU can go use in WHATEVER niche or industry you are in, because this campaign was NOT, I repeat, not in the internet marketing niche or anything close to it.

When you attend my case study clinic in three days, you will also receive a cool gift from us:

An entire step by step (literally) training program on exactly how to set this entire campaign up for you INCLUDING the pages, emails, and sales letter template.

This is an "over the shoulder" video training watching Macaully actually set it up WITH YOU in real time. How cool is that?

We love to over deliver for you, and speaking of that, this video training includes two more full campaigns we've successfully used including one that created a 100k/month side business for our client (more on that story in the clinic) that you can copy and use as well.

Let me be perfectly clear here:

This bonus is a full blown training suite recorded by my business partner who actually built this stuff. This is not just some training, this is Macaully actually doing the campaign in the trenches with You - something that actually worked.

If any of the "tech" stuff intimidates you, Macaully will take care of you and this is a complementary (and almost too nice) bonus... and you'll get it when you register for the clinic right now.

The last clinic I held was for writing posts like these and it was a hit, we had 60+ of you sign up within a moment's notice and loved every minute of it. I have had messages from people saying how much it has helped them move forward, I'm sure you've seen them, and this one will be no different. We're fully expecting over a hundred people on this bad boy.

As always, I am commited to keeping the price fair for everyone so when you sign up, you'll get:

- Access to the live case study clinic

- A video recording of it

- MP3 recording of it

- Prepared summary notes

- The same sales letter template

- Email templates

- Webpage templates

- An entire "watch over our shoulder" video training suite on how to put together the entire campaign (and two others) using the various programs/software

For only $197.

Hot damn! Who's got your back!? There's one pressing issue though: We broadcast live three days from now, so you have just 74 hours to sign up and that's it. This is going to be big, and It's a no brainer - link is in the comments!

We expect over 100 of you to join us for this clinic and just know this will be the only time ever I do this. If you miss out, that's it.

Through this training I hope to etch permanent scratches on the spinning record of your mind to what is possible for you.

From here on out, when you think about what you can achieve, I want you to look at this campaign I've opened up to you and go "Yes, they weren't any more special than I am, I really CAN do this." And you can. See how its done by signing up!

P.S. This is for you if you are one of two types of people:

1\. You have an existing business and want massive progress and insight into your own marketing by getting a rare behind the scenes look at a very successful campaign you can replicate yourself

2\. You do not have a business but are curious about what a 1.6 million dollar a month promotion looks like and how you could use it knowing the information and insight from this promotion is timeless and relevant and will get you a little closer to your dreams.

This is NOT for you if you can barely afford it, or if you feel like the information inside has to work in order to feed you. This is for the curious person who doesn't need to decide "Mitch's clinic or rent" and the already "up and running" entrepreneur.

P.P.S. I stand behind my promises - if you go through this training and feel it wasn't worth your money, I'll refund it in a heartbeat AND... let you into any future clinic we hold on our dime until you are fully satisfied. So you literally have nothing to lose and massive new insight and done for you materials to gain! Like I said, this is a one time ever offer, so take advantage of our over-delivering generosity and proven track record of excellent trainings.

P.P.P.S. Afraid to sign up, not knowing if it's right for you? That's why i stress the refund guarantee. Continually investing in yourself is a mindset, and just one golden nugget can change the direction of your life so sign up now, you got nothing to worry about ![][image29]:)

P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.S x Infinity to the power of 12\. I'll be demonstrating universal principles through this example so this applies no matter the industry or niche you are in/thinking of being in.

The Case Study Clinic is July 27th at 11 am EST (72ish hours from now), will last roughly 3 hours, and link to grab a spot is the first comment. If you can't make it live, a package of the recording and materials will be sent to you. When you sign up, youll get a private viewing link, show up on time and prepare to be fascinated, entertained, and inspired.

You gotta decide now, this is your last chance because we start in an hour...

I'll never do it again, so jump on it now and thank me later.

What is it?

Mac and I were talking about our biggest client success stories and failures, we've had both.

It's a tough road...

We thought it would be inspirational and instructive to share one of them with you, mostly to show you it isn't that difficult when you can just get a few things right - get these few things right and you can give yourself room for error while still winning.

So, we wanted to share one of these with you but thought to really give you the full understanding of how you can get value out of it, it would need to be a class.

We didn't want to sell anything on the class but we didn't want to do the for free, and I know you guys don't mind paying a fair price for something as long as it's worth it and has a money back policy should you decide it's not for you.

Below i describe the details of the class you are joining us on in an hour.

**Don't worry, if you can't make it, you can get a copy of the class and all the goodies BUT we aren't selling it after right now so this is the only way to get it**

Make sure you read the details below because I am giving you the class, AND a full blown, previously unreleased home study course for free (It has a $997 value and you'll understand why when you read about it)

Details are below, and you can quickly sign up here right now so you don't miss out:

- A video recording of it

- MP3 recording of it

- Prepared summary notes

- The same sales letter template

- Email templates

- Webpage templates

- An entire "watch over our shoulder" video training suite on how to put together the entire campaign (and two others) using the various programs/software

For only $197.

Hot damn! Who's got your back!? There's one pressing issue though: We broadcast live two days, so you have 10 minutes to sign up and that's it. This is going to be big, and It's a no brainer.

We expect over 100 of you to join us for this clinic and just know this will be the only time ever I do this. If you miss out, that's it.

Through this training I hope to etch permanent scratches on the spinning record of your mind to what is possible for you.

From here on out, when you think about what you can achieve, I want you to look at this campaign I've opened up to you and go "Yes, they weren't any more special than I am, I really CAN do this." And you can. See how its done by signing up!

P.S. This is for you if you are one of two types of people:

1\. You have an existing business and want massive progress and insight into your own marketing by getting a rare behind the scenes look at a very successful campaign you can replicate yourself

2\. You do not have a business but are curious about what a 1.6 million dollar a month promotion looks like and how you could use it knowing the information and insight from this promotion is timeless and relevant and will get you a little closer to your dreams.

This is NOT for you if you can barely afford it, or if you feel like the information inside has to work in order to feed you. This is for the curious person who doesn't need to decide "Mitch's clinic or rent" and the already "up and running" entrepreneur.

P.P.S. I stand behind my promises - if you go through this training and feel it wasn't worth your money, I'll refund it in a heartbeat AND... let you into any future clinic we hold on our dime until you are fully satisfied. So you literally have nothing to lose and massive new insight and done for you materials to gain! Like I said, this is a one time ever offer, so take advantage of our over-delivering generosity and proven track record of excellent trainings.

P.P.P.S. Afraid to sign up, not knowing if it's right for you? That's why i stress the refund guarantee. Continually investing in yourself is a mindset, and just one golden nugget can change the direction of your life so sign up now, you got nothing to worry about ![][image29]:)

P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.P.S x Infinity to the power of 12\. I'll be demonstrating universal principles through this example so this applies no matter the industry or niche you are in/thinking of being in.

The Case Study Clinic begins right now, and will last roughly 3 hours. When you sign up, youll get a private viewing link, show up on time and prepare to be fascinated, entertained, and inspired. Hurry!

**POST #5**

I'm holding a special class 7.5 hours from now where I give you a peek behind the curtains of a milti-million dollar campaign from start to finish.

Most people keep what really works secret. Most people don't ever get to be involved in milti-million dollar launches. And if you are fortunate enough to be on the inside of one, you realize something startling...

It ain't that difficult to do. And the million dollar campaign isn't that much different than things you may be trying. Just a few distinctions and tweaks, which I'm going to share with everyone smart enough to get on this.

Like I said, one time only, and you miss this, you miss it. Here's the post where I describe exactly how you are going to get Well over $1000 worth of value at 80% off and an inside look/million dollar fast track education into a very successful marketing campaign you can steal and copy pieces from.

**Continuity**

**200 ppl @ $47/month in 2 days**

Today is my birthday but I want to give you a gift instead...

I want to give YOU a gift for MY birthday... Well more than a gift, it's also a blatant and shameless bribe.

I want to send you a whole bunch of gifts today to get you to try out my brand new monthly membership program.

This stuff cost me a fortune in time, energy, resources, and teamwork to make.

This is my life's work and I want you to know this birthday giveaway is only valid for the next 48 hours. So with that said, here's what you are getting:

The first thing you are getting is 30 hours of edited footage of a very special copywriting and marketing event we held in Thailand just a few months ago.

This wasn't one of those lame seminars where everyone was bored and exhausted, where the only fun you have is outside at the bar. This was a very special event hosted by me, where I taught my copywriting secrets for the first time ever over 5 ENTIRE DAYS.

You'll watch me go through entire sales letters I personally wrote, line by line... sales letters which have made my clients millions of dollars in revenue.

You'll get a backstage peek into my mind and how I craft this kind of copy. You'll get templates, examples, and swipes you can put to work for you so you can make a lot more money quickly.

In fact, don't take my word for it, watch the video to hear what a few of the 30+ attendees had to say about their experience.

Before you order this, I want to send you a few more gifts today.

The next one being the edited footage of a two day event we recently held in Canada where you will get to discover the foundational basics of starting an online business, including sales tactics (exactly what to say), Facebook ad secrets (including some never before taught targeting secrets), and you get to witness actual hot seats where I drilled into, pretty ruthlessly, people just like you who are just getting started.

I gave them awesome plans of action, and you can use them too.

Now, there's two more gifts I want to give you today, just for trying out our new monthly program which I'll tell you about in a second.

The next gift you are going to get is a completely UNRELEASED, set of videos. I have never released these before, and you'll absolutely love them.

I sent this to a few of my friends, and it is by far the most well received thing I've ever published. Out of the last 3 years of consistently publishing this kind of material, people have responded more positively to this than anything else I've ever done. I almost didn't film these as I didn't think anyone would be interested.

But I was dead wrong.

I call this set of videos, Mitch Miller's Mind Candy.

I've accumulated these from over 10 years of fixing my brain. Going from homeless to living in mansions, traveling the world, living wherever I want and doing whatever I want, I had to fix my thoughts.

These 24 never before seen videos are the 24 "pieces of mind food" I had to ingest that allow me to do what I do, which is basically move mountains. You'll make all the money you want when you put this mind candy to work for you in your own mind.

I began formulating them back in 2008 when I was homeless and needed to get my head straight. These are the tools which changed everything for me.

The last thing I am going to send you is a private access code to something very dear to my heart.

This normally costs $2,000, but today and ONLY FOR THE FIRST 20 PEOPLE (**Edit** Fuck it, everyone can have it) who take me up on this... I'll grant you lifetime COMPLIMENTARY access to... Copy Penthouse Writing System.

This is our flagship program filled with my personal copy training, templates, examples, and teachings designed to make you money immediately.

You may be shocked right now I am giving this away only for the next 48 hours. This is my reverse birthday gift to you.

Here's what this is going to do for you:

- You are going to make more money

- You are going to finally know what to say to get people to give you money

- Persuasion is going to be easy for you from here on out

- This will help you in every area of life

- People rave about this program and you will too

So that was the welcome kit. The welcome kit is my shameless bribe to get you to try out the most exciting program we have ever released, hands down.

We call it Proven & Profitable: Plans, Secrets, And Support To Big Money And A Better Life Through Business.

This is a monthly program designed from the ground up to do what most programs can not:

Provide consistent mentoring and support, paired with a proven road map, laid out bare for you to use.

This is your opportunity to live a new kind of life.

This is for the underdogs. This is for the school that failed you. This is for you if you have people in your life who don't believe in you. This is your chance to prove them wrong like I did.

We specifically made this a monthly program for extremely important reasons: We don't typically need more information, we need the RIGHT information and ONGOING support and accountability.

Our core philosophy is to provide you with:

1\. Clear, proven money making plans

2\. Updated and ongoing strategies and training

3\. Support and mentoring

4\. Inspiration and ideas through special guest spotlights

5\. A behind closed doors look at what is working in our business

Every single month you'll get a virtual package delivered to you online which consists of 5 carefully selected things:

The first thing we call "Behind Closed Doors".

This is where you'll get to look over our shoulders as we do business. You'll get to sit in on meetings, making deals, and running our business. We do not share this side of our life online and as a member, you'll be on the inside, full of VERY valuable insight on how we run a business like this.

The next piece you'll receive every month is my personal favorite, we call these our "Spotlights".

We investigate and track down people who have unusual little money making ventures anyone can start. These are proven and profitable businesses and we have these people agree to have a conversation with me about what it is and how you can do it to. Then we take the conversation and make summary notes and a mini-game plan for you to follow yourself.

THESE ARE SOLID GOLD.

Especially if you aren't 100% sure what kind of business you want to get into.

For example, our first spotlight is a man named Dean who has been flipping an item we are all very familiar with yet never think about and it's not houses. It's made him a lot of money. It's slightly unusual yet, as you'll hear, you can make 500-1500 cash in as little as 4 days! I had Dean reveal his business plan and it's yours when you join us.

The next piece you'll receive every single month is what we call "Progress packs".

Building a proven and profitable business comes down to 6 steps. There are 6 steps, and inside those 6 steps are little milestones. We have mapped it all out for you.

I'll give you a little secret actually, I'll reveal it right now.

Inside your members area, we have put together a core training program with over (8 hours) that not only teaches the 6 steps to starting your very own money making business, but we mapped out and taught all of the milestones in between you will go through on the way to your new life of freedom and control.

From A to Z, I teach you exactly how to start a business that funds a better life for you and it is a training you can always go back to depending on what stage you are in.

And so in addition to that core training, we have a monthly progress pack.

This is a topic of our choosing that will be new content I do not teach for free on Facebook and it is designed to keep you going and on the right track. Special insight, only shared with you guys.

And that really is part of the magic here - the community inside.

This is as close as you are going to get to having me personally mentor and coach you. My team and I will be able to personally guide you to a profitable business as quickly as possible.

Ongoing coaching, accountability, and support IS truly the missing link in you succeeding or failing... environment is everything. And this is THE reason this is a monthly program - the support/coaching/and accountability.

You want to finally succeed? This is how you do it.

BONUS: Every single month, my friends and I will be talking about a specific topic in a segment we call Trends & Predictions.

Every month we go deep on a topic related to the future of business and marketing. This is where we attempt to predict and see the future so you can make better business decisions in a world rapidly changing.

This month we will be playing and talking about Virtual Reality.

I'm going to send you all of this stuff I have talked about in the video so far:

The Thailand Copywriting Event, The Introduction to making money online event, my 24 unreleased mind fix videos, and our $2000 flagship Copy Penthouse Program + The first month of Proven And Profitable, along with the A to Z business plan training for only $47... today and tomorrow only.

I am taking a big risk here.

I know most people hate paying monthly for something unless it is REALLLLY good. And I want to show you how great this is and how long we've been working on it, and how this is the entire future of where we are moving our business to help you finally get real results. And so I am bribing you pretty heavily to get you to test this out and see the value.

And if you don't want to remain a member, just CANCEL within 30 days and you won't be billed another $47 from me.

You have absolutely nothing to lose, and a whole shitload to gain. The entire risk is on my shoulders. If you want to cancel, simply email my assistant Noe at Noe@opposedmedia.com

And you can keep all the stuff!

This is the kind of package people would easily pay over $3,000 for and you are getting it All for only $47 today.

Now, I'm gonna back off from convincing you of this for a minute and kinda weed out the weak and non-committed.

This isn't for everyone, my stuff isn't for everyone. You should know my programs are expensive, they are generally not cheap. Copy Penthouse alone sells for 2k.

Now, if you decide to stay on as a member, you will be paying $47 per month.

We have set the price at this because we literally have fans and students from all over the world. From Pakistan to Las Vegas. It is VERY important to us that anyone who is serious about living a better life, can have a shot at it and be mentored by me.

There are so many people who follow me who have been dying for something affordable and this is it. THIS is our new flagship.

That said, if you need to sell a kidney or your child to do this, then it is best you just pass on this limited time offer and let someone else take your place.

If you can't take and follow directions, this is NOT for you.

My stuff works, it's been documented to work, I have testimonials and message proof the people who apply what I teach make money... but if you don't work it, nothing will work for you.

You also need ongoing tweaking and adjusting, that's WHY we are doing this monthly - it's critical to your success - anything else is a disservice.

Yes my stuff works. It's proven. But it's all dependent on you. You have to be willing to take action. Now, our monthly proven and profitable program is specifically designed for you if you have ZERO idea about business, and no idea what you even want to do yet, we help you figure that out.

It's also designed for you anywhere along the path to a profitable business and beyond. That's because the core training helps you at whatever level you are at PLUS the monthly progress packs and content touches on all different levels and grades.

With that said, if you meet this criteria, I think you are really gonna get a lot of benefit from this.

So here's what you need to do next:

You know this is a winning offer.

And you know it's not going to last more than 48 hours from now.

The reason I'm doing this is because I know our monthly program is the future of our business and your success, and the community and tight knit gang we will create inside will be legendary. So I am giving a real big bribe and gift to get you, my CURRENT follower, into this program before we roll it out to the public.

This is a program we will be doing for the next 20 years and this is your chance to be founding members.

Just go to the first comment and you'll find the link to sign up right now.

This is my birthday promotion, and 48 hours from now it disappears.

So, I'll see you on the other side as a member of Proven And Profitable, and I hope you'll enjoy all the stuff I send you.
