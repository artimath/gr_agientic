# **BRIEF**

# 1\. Who's the Audience?

**_[Note: Pull from demographic research in Research Doc]_**

# 2\. What are the pain points, or biggest fears?

**_[Note: Pull from pain point question in mechanism doc, reverse the hopes and dreams in research doc, extract from failure research in research doc.]_**

**_(+ identify the 1-3 HUGE ones, while the rest are secondary)_**

**- Short Term:**

**-Long Term:**

# 3\. So by reversing the pain points/biggest fears, what is the one big promise (1-3 sentences) you are going to make...how this will change their lives forever?

**_[Note: Tease what new discovery and transformation will be possible when they read this letter without giving it away..]_**

# 4\. What solutions for the reader's problem (s) exist already (and why aren't they working for them)?

**_[Note: Pull from research doc, what have they tried before section..]_**

# 5\. What's the new claim/root cause/surprising info? And how does this new solution we're offering them work? {Mechanism}

**_[Note: Pull from mechanism doc.]_**

_(Think about it as if they had 99% of the solution already, but you're sharing that missing 1%...the easy but unexpected REAL REASON, or REAL SECRET to their success)._

**---> Add any proof elements here:**

**---> Any Mechanism Names here:**

# 6\. Paradoxical Question:

```
**Rooted in the mechanism, these are questions that get the reader thinking**
```

# 7\. Metaphor:

# 8\. Bold Claim

**_(What's the huge promise about the results they're going to get using this product/solution?):_**<br>
**---> Dimensionalize your benefits!**

# 9\. What is the Product?

**_(If you can write out fascinations here, it will help you immensely. This is the part where you get to shape exactly what the product we're selling will include)_**

# 10\. Background Story + Story of Discovery:

**---> the more you can connect the story with the UM-P + UM-S, the better**

# 11\. Some Headline Ideas:

**_(One sentence â€“ something that would be the first line of the VSL, or in the copy above the video screen. Attention grabbing)_**

# 12\. Ideas for a potential upsell product?

**_(Something that could be sold to the customer immediately after purchasing the main product. You'd want this to be related to product, but solve an additional problem, or provide a significant additional benefit)._**
