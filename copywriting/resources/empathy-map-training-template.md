**Three things:**

1\. Ask questions (four initial ones)

2\. Create an empathy map (data driven)

3\. Create an avatar (story-based) from that empathy map.

**STEP 1: Answer These Four Questions**

**1\. What is the end result that your ideal customer wants to achieve?**

**2\. What are the elements required to get to this end result (the steps...the sticking points or roadblocks.**

**3\. What can you give them (as in information) that will move them close to that end result (one step at a time, then another, then another).**

**4\. What is the biggest fear they have that's preventing them from getting to the end result? (hind: find the pain!)**

**STEP 2: Build an Empathy Map**

It's a map of someone else's point of view (POV). What do THEY see, say, think, feel, and hear?

It's THEIR perspective, world view, emotions, and beliefs.

It allows you to develop a better understanding of your customer's environment, behavior, concerns, and aspirations.

**1\. What Does He See?**

Describe what your ideal customer sees in him environment:<br>
What does it look like?<br>
Who surrounds him?<br>
What types of offers is HE exposed to daily?<br>
What problems does HE encounter?

**2\. What Does He Hear?**

Describe how the environment influences your ideal customer.

What do his friends say?

Who really influences him, and how?

**3\. What Does He Really Thinking & Feel?**

Try to sketch out what goes on in your ideal customer's mind:

What is really important to him (which he might not say publicly)?

Imagine his emotions. What moves him?

Try describing his dreams and aspirations?

**4\. What Does He Say & Do?**

What is his attitude?

What could he be telling others?

Pay particular attention to potential conflicts between what a customer might say and what he may truly think or feel.

**5\. What is His Pain?**

What are his biggest frustrations?

What obstacles stand between him and what he wants or needs to achieve?

Which risks might he fear taking?

**6\. What Does He Gain?**

What does he truly want or need to achieve?

How does he measure success?

Think of some strategies he might use to achieve his goals?

What down as many answers as you can think of. There's no such thing as too much info here. Just make sure anything you write is related to the problem your ideal customer is trying to solve.

**STEP 3: Create a Customer Avatar**

This is the final step in the process of customer insights.

Basically you turn your empathy map into a story, with as much emotions as you can extract from your empathy map.

**Where To Find Answers**

You should have a hypothesis on who your demo is. Either from past experience selling to them, or through researching competitors and seeing what their demographics look like.

**Ask yourself what news/reporting websites your demographic visit frequently?**

Go visit them and look for the most attention grabbing, and polarizing headlines. Read those stories (and note biases in reporting), then review comments. Make notes of comments that stand out to you. You're looking for passionate comments. Confessional comments. Personal comments. Look for common threads too, ideas that keep being repeated. Write all of this down.

**Visit Forums.**

Similar to research component in RMBC method. Go to forums filled with your target customer. Note the kind of language they are using. What are they talking about consistently? What do they believe to be true. What are their problems and pain points. You'll get tons of answers here.

**Visit Them On Facebook**

Look at your target customers on Facebook. This is actually pretty easy. Find a group on FB that's public and filled with your target customers. Look at posts that are getting the most engagements and read the comments. But don't stop there. When you see comments that are really interesting, click on the profiles of those people. What are they posting about on their own pages? How are their friends reacting to those posts? What are the common threads?

**Interview/Survey Them (Optional)**

If you have the ability to, it's a great idea to find people who match your target market and talk with them. Ask them questions from the list in this document (phrased in a way that won't make them guarded). Write down their responses. If you have the means, you can also run surveys or polls to existing customer databases, or through online traffic you control.

**STEP 1: Answer These Four Questions (Example – HLH)**

**1\. What is the end result that your ideal customer wants to achieve?**

**Health:**

Destroy their diabetes.

Feel better.

Lose weight.

Have more energy and a better sex drive.

Regain their youth (go back to who they were in their late 20s early 30s).

Feel young again without the sacrifice.

Return to a simpler, happier, care-free, healthier time in their lives.

**Political:**

See a country that retains its traditional values. God in the classroom. Pro family values. Pro gun. Less of these minorities ruining things. No more illegals. No more blue collar jobs being destroyed. No more welfare state.

A hypothetical (but real to them) yester-year where everything was simpler and better. Mayberry. They didn't worry about ISIS or the minority next door. There wasn't all of this science challenging God. There wasn't all of this complication or political correctness. You lived in a neighborhood with people you knew from a similar background, you worked hard and collected an honest living, it was simple. There wasn't this government or these liberals trying to rip away all of those hard earned freedom. God wasn't a dirty word. Neither was Jesus or Christianity. We could speak our mind without being terrified of the consequences. These fucking Muslims weren't trying to destroy us. We didn't have a fucking Muslim President trying to destroy our country. Government wasn't trying to ruin (or control) our lives.

A return to the REAL America. I love the image of the rugged frontiersman with a family and a church. Christian values. Peggy Lee at a fucking sock hop. All of that shit.

**2\. What are the elements required to get to this end result (the steps...the sticking points or roadblocks?**

**Health:**

Dietary. I should be eating less fried food, drinking less soda, less candy and chips, less snacks. It's hard though: I don't feel full when I eat some bland chicken breast and steamed veggies.

Exercise. I don't have time to go to a gym. Or maybe I do, but it's expensive. I don't have the self-discipline though I hate admitting that. So I'd rather think that I'm busy than anything else.

**Political.**

Need to get a true conservative in the white house. Need to repeal Obama Care. Need to secure our borders. Need to bring back American manufacturing jobs. Need to send Muslims back to their sand-dune ass-stains of a country.

Seriously though, it's all fucking nostalgia. Need to get back to a simpler time.

**3\. What can you give them (as in information) that will move them close to that end result (one step at a time, then another, then another)?**

**Diet and Exercise:**

You don't need to count calories or obsess over eating bland food. Yes, there are certain recipes and meals that are more important than others. But ultimately, the first step is getting the right nutrients.

Here's the issue: do you know how your health issues occur? Like what _is_ diabetes...what _is_ heart disease...what _is_ obesity...what _is_ Alzheimer's?

That's the thing – you're being told to change your diet and cut all of this stuff out of it, but you don't even really understand why?

So the information they need is how to get to that result without confusion, mixed messages, or a lot of hassle and work. It's simpler than they think. It's not about exercise alone, or diet. It's about just doing things that specifically address and destroy the symptoms of your conditions and diseases.

**Political:**

Tell them that there is hope. Paint a picture of a world where God is back in the classroom, the home, the workplace, everywhere. Where we haven't strayed from our American values. Where Mayberry still exists.

Tell them it's as simple as joining the movement. Show them signs that there is progress. Start with the evocative fear, but then also show them that there's a solution to that fear. Our job is to relieve that fear and emotion for them, slowly, bit by bit.

**4\. What is the biggest fear they have that's preventing them from getting to the end result? (hind: find the pain!)**

**Health:**

I can't do it. I'm too old. I'm already too far gone. It's too late for me. I don't have the money for the operation/procedure I need. I don't want to be embarrassed when I go to the gym. I'm never able to follow through on a diet, even when I start one.

**Political:**

I'm just one person. I'm going up against a massive Liberal-Empire. Government is corrupt. Politicians on both side of the aisle are corrupt. Big business runs things, and there's no backbone in Washington. Obama's government is moving so fast to take away our freedoms and liberty – what if it's too late. More and more of these college-kid, liberal idiots are taking control of things.

**STEP 2: Build an Empathy Map (Example, HLH)**

**1\. What Does He See?**

**Describe what your ideal customer sees in him environment:**

He sees political correctness taking over. A president who hates the troops and who is at war with Christianity. Young students, college students, professors, half the country trying to remove God from the national vocabulary. To turn the country into an Islamic-Socialist state.

The government trying to take our rights every chance they get. To control everything. To MAKE me love minorities, or MUSLIMS, or people I don't understand.

**What does it look like?**

It looks like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. It looks like atheism. It looks like King Obama. It looks like sex and loose morals. It looks like laughing at God. It looks like killing innocent unborn children and being proud about it.

**Who surrounds him?**

My buddies, my church members, my wife, my family, the people I work with. Fox News is on all the time. I love conservative blogs.

**What types of offers is he exposed to daily?**

Guns, gold, survival, miracle cures.

**What problems does he encounter?**

Not enough money and it's Obama's fault. Society crumbling. My own deteriorating health. Impotence. Diabetes. Obesity. I don't feel good anymore. Health care sucks and medicare doesn't cover a lot of stuff – that's Obama's fault too.

**2\. What Does He Hear?**

**Describe how the environment influences your ideal customer.**

It just reinforces what I already see. It reinforces the fact that this country is going down the shitter. Reinforces the fact that political correctness has taken the reigns, and won't let go. Reinforces that liberal-progressive ideology wants to transform the country I love, from something sacred to a red light district.

**What do his friends say?**

Oh, they know it's the same thing. They know Obama is going to take our fucking guns. They know Obama is a Muslim who wants to destroy America. They know that big special interest are controlling government. We know that America as we understand it is about to end.

**Who really influences him, and how?**

FOX News: the talking heads, the talking points. Conservative radio and blogs – giving me the truth, pointing out the issues, making it clear that things are changing and threatening our freedom and very way of life.

**3\. What Does He Really Think & Feel?**

**Try to sketch out what goes on in your ideal customer's mind:**

You've got college kids asking for free education. Who's going to PAY for that? You've got broke, welfare minorities asking for free healthcare? Who's going to PAY for that? Why don't they get a job? Why don't they work hard and serve our country? Why do they think they're entitled to a handout?

And meanwhile with my health: I really need to do something. I know that, my wife knows that, everyone knows that. But what? I tell myself I'm going to change my eating and my exercise. But I'm already in pain, already struggling. So how do I figure that out? It's too late for me anyways. I'm unhappy. I'm disgusted and sad that America is changing. This isn't the American I grew up with and love. Things are different now.

**What is really important to him (which he might not say publicly)?**

That we have a white male president. That the minorities don't change this country. That we don't become a welfare-socialist state.

**Imagine his emotions. What moves him?**

Fear of what's going to happen if things continue this way.

**Try describing his dreams and aspirations?**

Going back to Mayberry. Going back to when American was great. Return manufacturing jobs. Keep society stable. None of this progressive bullshit. People working hard to earn their keep. People loving this country. A president who doesn't apologize to the world for the U.S. Not becoming a Muslim-Socialist dictatorship like Obama wants.

Going back to when I was young, healthy, and happy. I broke my back working, broke my back serving this country. But beer was cheap, gas was cheaper, and the world was full of opportunity. I was proud to be an American. I was virile. Women were attracted to me. I did athletic stuff, played football, whatever. I want to be young again – I want to go back in time.

**4\. What Does He Say & Do?**

**What is his attitude?**

I'm smarter than the average person that's for sure, especially those idiots in Washington and these crazy liberals. My values are real – I understand that you don't get anything for free. I love America, but not the America that Obama and Hillary want. I love the America of Regan. Strong leadership. Standing up to threats, to Russian, to China. Bombing those ISIS bastards backs to their sand dunes. Oh and I'm very pro-israel too. I don't even fully trust the Jews, but Israel is important if Jesus is going to come again.

I'm just disgusted with this traitorous president.

**What could he be telling others?**

That America is DOOMED unless something radical happens. That we're living in the end times and the America of tomorrow will be radically different from the America of today. That they need to open their eyes, because we're in serious dangers.

**5\. What is His Pain?**

**What are his biggest frustrations?**

That the politicians in Washington don't seem to have a backbone or a spine. That special interests control everything. That we haven't just nuked these Muslims out of existence. That we're being tolerant of queers marrying, and turning America into a welfare state. That big companies abandon the U.S. and take jobs overseas.

Healthwise: That I can't lose weight, that my diabetes isn't getting better, that my blood pressure is too high. That it's not easy to fix this stuff. That it happened to ME when I used to be healthy, the stamina of an ox, I could work 12 hours, drink all night, and have sex with my wife until the sun came up, then do it all again. The image of who I am in my head, verse reality, is very conflated.

**What obstacles stand between him and what he wants or needs to achieve?**

Doesn't this go back to the roadblocks we already covered? Not going to answer this one too thoroughly.

**Which risks might he fear taking?**

Same thing – feel like I already covered this.

**6\. What Does He Gain?**

**What does he truly want or need to achieve?**

I feel like also already answered this.

**How does he measure success?**

Politically: American jobs return, a white male president, ISIS is destroyed, the bible back in every aspect of American life, we're a Christian country again with Christian values (like no more abortion).

Health wise: Seeing the number on the scale go down. Seeing my blood pressure and high cholesterol and high blood sugar go down. FEELING better, healthier. More energy. Less anger and depression.

**Think of some strategies he might use to achieve his goals?**

Diet pills. Books and programs he buys online. Trying to work out occasionally. Trying to go on diets. Miracle cures. Other pills and supplements. Praying.

What down as many answers as you can think of. There's no such thing as too much info here. Just make sure anything you write is related to the problem your ideal customer is trying to solve.

**STEP 3: Create a Customer Avatar (Example HLH)**

![][image1]<br>
_A picture of Mark (left, obviously)_

Mark is fed up. He's a 55 year old white, Christian male. He spends a lot of time feeling angry. When he's not feeling angry he feels sick. The only times he feels happy or laughs are when he's with his long-time friends having a beer, or occasionally when his wife says something surprising. More often than not though, even his laughter is a bitter, ironic type.

It wasn't always this way. Mark grew up poor in the South. But he also grew up in a time where there were jobs to be had. America was full of promise. Full of opportunity. If you worked hard, you could be sure that you'd have a roof over your head and food on your plate. You could provide for your family. You lived in a close-knit community of almost identical seeming folks, including the church. Life was simpler then. It was pre globalization. We were a country of values.

Now things have gone crazy. Not sure where it happened. Maybe when we lost the culture wars of the 80s. Regan was our last great president. Clinton had the morals of a pimp. Between MTV and reality TV and all the other garbage that's permeated society, it's just gone downhill fast. Feels like Liberal Professors have infiltrated college campuses and they are brainwashing our youth. Military Service is one of the greatest things you can do, yet a lot of these Liberals don't even respect the troops.

We put a black Muslim in the white house. It's just impossible to believe or accept, yet it happened. What is wrong with people. Obama wants to socialize everything. He hates our country. He's probably not even a U.S. Citizen. He wants to destroy America from the inside out, like a parasite that's infected its host. It's unbearable, there is a war being waged against Mark, a war he feels we're losing.

And layered on top of all of this is Mark's deteriorating health. Ever since he got injured on the job. He worked hard, so he's okay with the fact that he needs government support. He hates himself for it, but he got injured working at least, not like all those lazy freebie seekers out there who've never worked a day in their life. But since he can't move too good, his health has really gone down the tube. In fact, the health of his body and the health of America are pretty much analogous. It's the perfect metaphor. His health keeps getting worse just as America does. Just like he knows America needs to change, he knows that his body needs to change too. But in both cases he's also afraid that it's all too late. That this is the end. That scares him, makes him feel helpless, and makes him feel sad.

What Mark needs is to be thrown a life vest. He's wading in the water, and he feels like he's drowning. He needs something he can grab onto, that can pull him out of the water. Without much work, without it taking too much time, this needs to happen fast. And that's what we're going to offer him to do. He should feel patriotic about reclaiming his health. Getting a small victory today. It should give him hope that what starts with his personal wellbeing could be a sign that America's not doomed either. There is a chance at redemption.
